Guide to ATLAS.ti files

All of the files below were exported from the main project file called ‘JAY Lit corpus analysis.atlasti’. This file can only be opened with the ATLAS.ti application.

‘Code book’: A spreadsheet of the themes and their single-letter codes with an indication of the colours used. This file is useful as a summary of the codes.

‘Detailed report’: PDF report of all quotations from corpus texts and the codes assigned to them. This file is lengthy, but it is the most comprehensive record of the codes assigned by text with each relevant quotation.

‘Theme summary report’: A spreadsheet of each text with its associated themes. This file is useful as a text-by-text summary of themes identified.

‘Multi-hot coding record’: A spreadsheet of all theme codes assigned by corpus text. The data is recorded using multi-hot coding (0 if not identified or 1 if identified). This file was used in aggregating the coding data.
