Fight strong     Fight so strong till your last breath  that death postpones its appointment  vent out your weird wishes  wake up your dead soul  Pour out your heart's craziest desires  It's time to be the talk of the town  It's time to wear your crown  and drown purposely into the deep ocean  carefree  believe me  you decide your limits    Along the waves of sacrifice  Along the dance of a dice  Open your arms  welcome the risk  fresh like the mist  like you've never tasted failure  Collect the bits and pieces of losses  Toss the coin once again  Let it decide your fate
