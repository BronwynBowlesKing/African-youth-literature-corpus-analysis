Like the birds   Today like the birds welcoming a brand new day,  I sing myself out of a prison  A prison, I have held myself hostage,  My own cage.    I have held my breath more often than not,  I have hid my light under my arms so I would not make  anyone question their worth in my presence.  No race has ever been won with a head down,  no one has ever conquered an enemy they  could not look in the eye.    Keep smiling, you've been here before,  the wild dogs bit you time and again, but you survived!  Stop fearing your own magic,  stop giving yourself soundless claps.    Gloomy the days, dark the night or  tough the road today like the birds  welcoming a brand new day  I sing myself out of my prison.
