Walkin' thru Point Street    With every breath of greatness, a sea of misery awaits  These are the thoughts that exhume themselves within the tombs  Of anger from my sad, lonely heart as I  Journey around you –  Durban  Durban, you are a beauty  Yet how I love to hate you.    Durban, allow me not to speak about your breath-taking skyscrapers  Nor of your concrete beds cherished by the homeless.  Durban, you are a beauty  Yet how I love to hate you...    Durban, allow me not to speak about the yellow-bones  Nor of the dark-bones with curvaceous hypnotizing bodies  The beautiful dames who moonlight  For a mere hundred and forty bucks, whilst conjuring  Up an unbreakable courage beneath their crumbled spirit.  Durban, you are a beauty  Yet how  I love to hate you.
