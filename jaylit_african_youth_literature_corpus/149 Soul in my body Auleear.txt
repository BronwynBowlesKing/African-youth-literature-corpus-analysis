Soul in my body     Fire of Vengeance in my heart  They hurt my soul but I won’t lose hope  I will walk crowned with confidence  Night and day they have forced me to work  I have swallowed pain instead of rice  Burden ten times heavier than my body on my back  One piece of bread was my only desire  You won’t get bread here they replied  If you want to live, you must die everyday  If you want to open your eyes tomorrow, you must struggle till morning  Arms in their hands  Tears in my eyes  My hands and feet are still working with the fear fuelled in my heart  Stop torturing me  My soul will still be alive after my death  To prove my pain with pride  Yesterday blood was on the earth  Today ink will be on my page so that the past resurfaces  On the Indian Ocean  You are a Mauritian proud of your roots  Your existence proves your origin  Your blood is red but your soul has 4 colours  Red blue yellow green
