Affection     Love is what I thought  Was your only characteristic  You loved my self with so much obsession  Wow  Praise the desire of your heart  You destroyed me in such a way that  Happiness is now only a memory  I would have controlled my broken heart  But how can I control my broken self-respect,  My destroyed life  And my bleeding body parts  If this is the destiny of love  Then do one thing in front of everyone  Mix some sourness in your sweet talks  Before looking at me with your mesmerising eyes  Let me taste your anger
