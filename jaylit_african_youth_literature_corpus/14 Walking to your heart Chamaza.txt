Walking to your heart    When you sit on that hill,  If there is no love your soul can feel,  No shoulder to give you a home and hold you still,  Remember am on my way to pay that bill.    On my way to your heart,  I get lost in the frost and feel so much pain,  I walk slow in the mud and get cold in the rain,  But I've harvested too much love to make your tears drain.    All these dark days a sunset has to make,  If your bed is lonely nobody to kiss your neck,  Afraid of love wanting not a loving heart to break,  Am coming with love that thunders can't dare to shake.  From all three corners of your day,  There is really a shadow that wants you to see,  It may fall from this tree or move out of that sea,  But if you fail to explain love, just look up to me.    It’s easy to live in a world that  Knows not how to love,  But I can’t quit running to your heart  Though it is so hard to have,  Hear my footsteps when you close your ears,  See my smiles when you close your eyes,  Am walking to your heart.
