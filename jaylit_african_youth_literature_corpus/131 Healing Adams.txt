Healing    To sit with your pain  To know it  Let it rush in and face it  To know where it hides  In the dusty corners of your mind  The shattered pieces of your heart  The ones that don’t seem to fit together  To see it in the lines that trace your skin  Where battle lines were drawn    Our pain is a poison we drink often  For which time is the only remedy
