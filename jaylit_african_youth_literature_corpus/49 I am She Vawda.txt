I am She    I am She  who serves cereal for breakfast  and consciousness for lunch  so the youth have political banter on which to munch    I am She  who envisions a better world  while clad in PJs  and causes revolutions  in my Skechers,  which earn retribution    I am She  whose laughter swims against the tide,  enthralling the neighbouring village  until we share a common pride.    I am She  whose voice rattles the chambers of parliament  and emboldens others  to action    I am She  whose emotion lends longevity to art  and whose mind ignites  chaos in its interpretation    I am She  whose soul quakes  with love and laughter;  awaiting a lesson  in concealing the smile of my eyes    I am She  to whom the world may be unfair  but still I give to it my heart  labelled: ‘Fragile, Handle with Care’    I am She:  the raindrop clinging to the petals of time.  Paint me lurid      with brushstrokes that rhyme.    I am She  who devours headlines by day  and sips on prose by night,  all while reeking  of piss and promise.    I am She  who quotes personal observation,  stays up with Shakespeare  and falls asleep next to a saint.    I am She  who packs away the moon  and sings to the sun  so that the world is not dun.
