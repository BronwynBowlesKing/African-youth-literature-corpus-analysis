The world is no longer the same    The world is no longer the same,  The way to show love is no longer the same,  Hugging the one we love has made of one a fiend,  If someone stays away, he or she is a friend,    Staying at home now is a must,  There is no more trust,  However, we cannot let our hope go bust,    We currently live trapped in our homes,  We want to be like birds; the sky to roam,  Traveling the world is no longer a dream,  It has turned into something quite grim,    Coronavirus!  Damned coronavirus!  You brought with you a lot of displeasures,  You came to take our treasures,    Or do I say, blessed coronavirus?  Oh! On the other hand, family union made it worthwhile,  On every continent and country and in every isle,  You made us reflect on human life and its meaning,  You reminded us that we are nothing and that from nothing we will return to “nothing”,    Damned coronavirus!  I'm sorry, but you're still “DAMNED”  This is your last name,  It's enough!  The world has been through too much suffering,  From today, we promise to be different,  We have learned from this ordeal,  We promise to be citizens with conscious attitudes,  We have already mastered the ideal,    You can go away,  You belong to yesterday,  Now, we have mastered the aptitudes: believing, fighting and loving!  You don't need to keep returning!!
