A Portion of Earth    Pay close attention  To the melodies of your beauty  And listen carefully  To the rhythms of your scars.  For there are days  When eyes will disagree with  The truths of your beauty  And lips excavate  The regrets beneath those scars  But remember then that you are  A portion of Earth dipped in stars  And a chord of music  In an orchestra of a million guitars.
