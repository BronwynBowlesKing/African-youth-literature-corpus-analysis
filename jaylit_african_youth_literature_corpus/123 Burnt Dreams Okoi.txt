Burnt Dreams    When in time  We gather to dine  As brothers familiar  With anguish  Come with your scars  If you can, wear them  This is how we remind ourselves  Of the pain in each word  Uttered in silence – too numerous to count  Because of all the burnt dreams  And charred hopes  Ours is blackest  But boys like us were born  To play with flames.
