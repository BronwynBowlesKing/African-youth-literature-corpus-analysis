Letters to Heaven    Heavenly bliss entwined  With cloves of majestic aura;  Cloaks with multiple divine hues  Let me redefine this  Newly found  Love.    Letters to heaven  Let us go to heaven  Letters to heaven  May you  Reach  Heaven; find my mama’s haven and  Dine with  Her  Tell mama I think of her  Tell ma:  Ma, I try on a daily basis to be a good son.  Tell mama I am sorry that I no  Longer remember her smile  Nor her voice  Neither do I remember her complexion  Even though her phantom flickers  on the corners of my existence  Forever mocking my memory with shadows of her joyfulness    Tell mama I still remember what she told me when  I came back from school  With bruises on my heart  She said:  My son, in life, always pull your  Socks up.    Letters to heaven tell mama I  cry everyday  Letters to heaven tell mama  I have chosen to cry no more;  Tell mama it is not that I hate her  For leaving me an orphan –  I have to spread my wings  Be the masterpiece that  You wanted me to be.    Letters to heaven  Take me to heaven  Show me  Heaven.
