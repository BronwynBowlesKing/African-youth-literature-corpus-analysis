Tears    when you cry,  cry in the sunlight –  preferably with a mirror in hand.  look at how the droplets catch  and cradle the sunlight.  observe with blurry perspective,  how, in the bright hue, they possess the sun for a few seconds –  how they possess the most influential star we have in our universe.  Tears can be so powerful  and cleansing  that even stars want to revel in them  (because they have none of their own)
