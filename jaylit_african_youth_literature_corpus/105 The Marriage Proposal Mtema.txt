The Marriage Proposal     The sun was about to sink down the valley  Showing her dull shiny forehead  And her fingertips touching the treetops  As her long legs stretched across the Lake Nyasa beach  I sat on a mat,  Eyeing the horizon walls  My legs stretched  I felt powerless knowing what was coming  In no time ululations filled the air  As uncles and a group of women  Marched to where I was seated  I knew it would take more than courage  To lay down my intentions  For the woman I wanted to marry  In front of her kinsmen  Masked, they arrived  The prosecutor threw a glance at me  And motioned for me to speak  I mumbled  “Your seed will be safe in my hands.  Lobola is over there with my uncle.”
