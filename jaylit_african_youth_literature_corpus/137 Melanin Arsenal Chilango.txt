Melanin Arsenal        Dear black Sister,  you are the epitome of  beauty; heart of bayonet, spirit and bravery  hands stretched like canons, lips dropping wisdom  and eyes dreaming dreams  scribbled in the air; full of  sounds of ammunition for success  But in a community tainted with  tribal marks, your bravery is camouflaged,  and your future is blocked by racial boundaries     May your dark skin  reek sufficient melanin  and spank brutality  of politics on skin color.
