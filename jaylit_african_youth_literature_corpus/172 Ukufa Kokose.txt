Death  If only I could take a pen and inscribe my thoughts on the tablets of your hearts  My longing would flow into your souls, bringing peace and courage in its wake  Attempting to soothe the deep scars that have left your hearts drenched in sorrow  The soul now lies helpless, hope lost, and faith withers like a breeze too soft to hold on    You merciless thief, you rob parents and create orphans, wails echoing through the silence  While we are still drinking from the nurturing breast, you abandon us with fading memories  Death! You are chaos itself, you are even shaking the old, for you are the enemy who tears apart our homes    Come down to us too, you small creature! Enlighten us as to why you hate us so much  Oh, how I ache inside, worried for those still tender in age  For the day will come when they ask, "Where is our mother? Where is our father, brother?"  What will I say to them when they search for answers about the parents they never knew?  Which language will make them understand? What words can explain it all?    I feel like a lone cow left in my father's kraal, for you have taken everything from our home  The staff of guidance has broken, splintered, and now who will I turn to for support?  For I too am not strong in years, I was still looking to be strengthened by the elders  I, too, was just a calf nursing from my mother’s breast, looking to her for comfort and care    I never imagined such a time would come where I would stand alone, without anyone to cry to  The pain is deep, but I must gather strength, forced to stand tall like a pillar  The time has come for me to take on the role of my grandfathers, to call upon the likes of Phalo and Rharhabe  For this task belongs to them—they are the beginning and the end  I bow with the soul’s knee before you, my black nation, feeling the weight of this burden    I approach you at this moment as your son, asking you to show me the way  I do not blame you at all, ancestors of our people, for I believe you possess knowledge and wisdom beyond this world  With these words, I humbly ask for the strength to endure and face this trial. I give my thanks
