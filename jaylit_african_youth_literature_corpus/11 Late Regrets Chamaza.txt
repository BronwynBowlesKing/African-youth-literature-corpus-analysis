Late Regrets    I messed up yesterday       it was seen,      Am not waking up today    living by that same sin scene.    I left school, true fool,     They all say,      I work dirty at thirty,     Still making it that way.    Got pregnant, poor girl,    Suffered of course they could tell,   How I wish they were there to see,    What took me to that part of the sea.   Am here, am there,      No matter how or where,     It may be filthy, but I ceased to care,    Thats my share, Life aint always fair.
