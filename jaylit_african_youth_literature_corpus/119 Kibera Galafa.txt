  Kibera     I have a future tucked away  in chuckholes of the dusty paths  where a kid drowns hands to kill thirst  when there is mud and death floating  in a waste yard waiting for vultures  to wrestle for bones and rotting bread  in a gladiator’s ring erected from stripes of party cloth  hanging below shadows of skyscrapers from a distance  in the smoke fuming from dumps  and the burning car by the man with a panga  defending the honour in our heroes  with rats running over pots starving  in cold nights at the foot of Mt. Kenya.
