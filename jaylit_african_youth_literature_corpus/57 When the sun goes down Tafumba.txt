When the sun goes down    The ravishing rays of the sunset with my pain,  hoping not a brighter day yearns so much to be  called upon by the clock lest it brings along its burdens.  I am a recluse because during the day  I am the rays’ ransom finally free at  last when the sun goes down until it rises again,  I await to be sunstroke.  I witness the sun kiss the ground as  I kiss my day's trouble goodbye.    Lost in the dark visions of my mind  that will only make sense when the sun  goes down, throw me in the light!  I mean rescue me from the light because  I find comfort in darkness just as the sun lays to rest.  Let there be light, and I shall not be found.    I long for a horizon of new adventure that  awaits me when the sun goes down.  I long for the vivid visions I get in my sleep  awaiting to be put in place the next day just before  the sun goes up.    The shadows of the slowly dying sun vanishes with my sorrows.  Sorrows that made me mourn, watering the ground to  produce a fruit of hopelessness that awaits me to  shamelessly harvest it.    A sea of sorrow that welled inside me as  the sun goes down is done away with.  I long for dusk where peace resides,  and I gaze upon the day as it day dims my sorrows  welcoming the dark.  When the sun goes down.
