Tales at the River    The river connects you to yourself as the  ancestors dance with you in celebration,  The tales the fools tell, you stepping  into power unbothered as they watch as the water softly tackles you at your angle  They wait for your defeat as the river opens  Her anger passed the test of apostle  caste calculated realities of the innocence blindly held captivated by untruth  manifested by fear  The roads  Their illusion tames her fire  Eyes wide open    Your river people have arrived daughter  She is not alone in this twisted whip of thoughts  The ancient smoke as they flee like wildfire purifies her space  Her smile is genuine, her feet channelling her roots within  Double-check the door, leave the dirt by the door, stand by the stoep  Keep the pain and the heartache at the door  Clear your thoughts  The daughters can see it clearly now, with much sense to run in silence  Conqueror of adversity  The grandmothers left secrets at the river for the daughters to find when they are ready  Equity assertiveness, unshakable stubbornness, disobedience  Mother, people are throwing words at me People are throwing words at me    Open wide the window, the shallow low energies should leave  Emotions and ancestors as the tears water seeds of success  The majestic trees of Tsumeb understand her sexuality  They shield her from the prophet that gaslights her to question her Bodily autonomy  The fundamentalists are reorganizing  Is it genuinely yours those thoughts that make you doubt yourself, daughter  The grandmothers left secrets at the rivers  The water is gone, only thing left is the whispers in the wind  That fills you up with gratitude.  She stretches her arms wide open almost to touch the universe  She held everything she needs and wants  within her palm  She smiles back at her chasing her worries out of the window  People, My people, I am better today    Yesterday I was numbed by capitalist expectations  Black tax and black queer Bodies  Entangled hopelessness of unemployment  Stuck with hope to break free, not realizing that she is  The wildest presentation of autonomy  Her grandmother never imagined  The angelic whisper of her grandmother through the wind  The river dance expresses the spirit in a physical form  She is moulding herself back to freedom  She wears her pleasure as red as her thong laced up with confidence  She belongs to herself, holding herself accountable to her destiny  She minds her thoughts, fulfilled by the joy of the moment  Her Africa is returning within herself    She has never experienced love as divine  As her tears moulding her back to herself to growth and resilience  The resilience of a black lesbian  Whose dirty laundry hangs in the archives of  Cultural silencing of inequitable gender norms as  Her mental health hangs between self-harm and unheard  Whispers of her grandmothers    Grandmothers keep dancing in her dreams  Leading her to the river she once had forgotten  They don’t discriminate  Clapping their worn hands to the dominance of the spirit of their daughter    You are not here for them to understand you  Generations of your mothers, grandmothers, scaling up from  1936, 1957, 1989, 2000, 2020  Same spirit  Different lifetimes  Travelling beyond the limitation of time  Transferring knowledge of grandmothers through the wind  Erongo Mountains remain the same  As firm as your faith  As the seasons weather.
