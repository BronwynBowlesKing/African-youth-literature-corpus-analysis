Not my fault    To be born unwantedly  Not my fault to have fertilised the ovum  Not my fault again  To be a victim of disdain  My dear  I know I am not your dear  Here I am  What a destiny  I will die before being born  I will be torn to pieces  And it will not be done easy  Bit by bit  I will disappear  From my home  Which I considered my own  I will be torn  Before taking my first breath  It was not my fault  To be alive
