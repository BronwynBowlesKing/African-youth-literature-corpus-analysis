The Mourning After  We came back  because apartheid was over...  ah-ah-ah, not so fast.  Dink nou weer.  White, Black, Indian, Coloured;  Wit, Swart, Indies, Kleurling,  the old monikers remain –  expelled in the hangover breath  of our liberators turned bureaucrats,  belched onto every form and application.  “Ethnicity?  No, South African’s not an option.”  Race sticks to us like generational sweat  that can only be washed by generational soap.  But then, our liber-crats might argue,  hungover is better than hanged.
