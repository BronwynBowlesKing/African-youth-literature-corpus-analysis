This Home    Here lies a ruptured soul  A flinty being.  A heart with a hole;  A pit for love burying.  On this epitaph, truth hopes to survive  Where lies live in abundance  And trust is strong and alive  In a casket of buried conscience.  Here, loneliness is a lovely sensation  That satisfies hunger in quiet  For solitude is a nutrition  And poetry a balanced diet.  A lone spirit  In a body that echoes laughter  Where every door in is an exit  And doors are shut thereafter.
