Escape plan      Never blossomed from a loving society  Sprouted from various branches  The thickness of blood and water’s paleness  My life was not promised  My destiny was not defined    I was taught by many diverse teachers  Felt if I exited, no one would miss me  Clouded by ironies  All I could remember was pains  Immature but mature in thought  Had immense love to share  Yet no one to receive  My shadow was my best friend    Episodes of pains replaying  Every day was a musical rotation  Could not stop dancing  Even if I did not enjoy the tune    My skin was magnetic to catastrophes  My tomorrow was rued  My nickname was Mistake  My biggest fear was becoming a burden to somebody  Life was an acrimony  Life and I, put in a ring  Nearly swallowed  But fought through  I won  I conquered  I dissolved my imperfections and impurities  My blessings came running back to me  My unspoken words finally came singing out loud  My desires resurrected  My destiny was promised  Strength, my alpha  I beat the odds  Wore redemption clothes  My life had meaning  Planted love, fed a nation  Taste, bitter to sweet  My dynasty was ruled by me  Started dining with royals  My entire kingdom was made  Through my battleships and integrity    Birds of hope, I flew  Bread of hope, I consumed  Body of amour, I wore  Shield of strength, I fought  Tongue of wisdom, I spoke  Favors of men, I encountered  Inspirations, I dished out  Motivations, I blessed  Light of life, I believed  Truth of life, I birthed  Rose of life, I loved  Hope of life, I lived.
