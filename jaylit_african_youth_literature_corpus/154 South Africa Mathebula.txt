South Africa      My home of joy without happiness  The house with loud laughter  And family dances but no peace  With united broken hearts  Yet as cold as isolation    Churches with cultures while the gospel is missing  Elsewhere the priests are misleading with the same feared name  In worship they claim the price of praise  Through miraculous actions we bow  For nobody knows who the Savior really is  Masked as they come, nothing isn’t what it seems  What are you really chasing, if it ain’t true  For truth lives amongst each one of us    Yesterday my backyard was a place of praise  Today the same yard becomes a playground  For I have been injured here  Where my siblings grew freely  Playing with tins, mistakenly stamped on a broken bottle  The same my brother used to sip alcohol through  Through depression he was careless  Throwing it away with anger towards his background  Knowing that nobody has his back  Since it isn’t as round as the world  Yet I ache in pain viewing his future  So Leathered with darkness  Even education can’t lighten it    But a true player can brighten  The whole country  My South Africa is at stake  While we busy slicing the truth  And preparing lies to serve our loved ones.
