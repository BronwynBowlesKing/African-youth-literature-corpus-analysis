At the end of the day     At the end of the day  I am all alone  Tick-tocks louder than grenades  That’s when reality takes charge    At the end of the day  I remove my glasses  And everything becomes blurry  A reminder of my nerve’s fury    At the end of the day  I remove my masks  Going back to my element  A reminder that I only live to impress people    At the end of the day  The silence is overwhelming  For fear to face the void in my soul  A reminder of my superficiality
