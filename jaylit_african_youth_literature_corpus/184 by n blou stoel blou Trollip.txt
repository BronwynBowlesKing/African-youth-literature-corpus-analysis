at a blue chair, blue    in my mind he’s navy blue, velvet, and almost too inviting  possibly still nameless, but his place is fixed  the one place in this suffocating universe where I can  attend to, darken, embody and exist for now  in this one chair, blue    place, space and time are never the same, I know  envision migrating birds, Hans Faverey, Heraclitus  but that doesn’t deter me from embracing the navyness  with a consuming yearning my soul longs for more blue  could one chair be the place where I can be without regret?    a blue chair obviously goes hand in hand with a blue double wick candle  it smells like the sun and freedom and all my already written letters  I forever each good wish for each good person in the flames  but it is challenging alone in this blue, to just think  without imagining, fantasising about what could be in a blink of an I    dependant on my effort to be better today  to know yesterday and tomorrow are formless  I stay blue chair-seated for a while longer than initially intended  because I don’t know what beyond the blue awaits  it is possibly unwise to just expect the worst    unceremonially the outside-of-the-blue things merely continue  there isn’t really something waiting only for me  I want to believe there are people or things holding their breath  important fulfilling things that are waiting for me  miraculously I am saved and know peace and a few tears wait in the surrendering to the blue.
