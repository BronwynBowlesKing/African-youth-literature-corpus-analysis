Remember me     Do you remember  How teasing your eyes were  When we kissed  That night?  Time stopped ticking  And the dark skies dissolved into a smile  Fast the days fleeted  When our love drift was a-water  Then you shrank from love battles  And life-woe bidding you obeyed  My Strife unremitting  And you slowly carved my heart  Throwing away the fragments of sense I had left  Here I am crying to the wind  As if my tears will not turn into clouds  Only to come back as raindrops  With you my African queen,  I must tread this path (still)  For “Courage is not the absence of fear”  Such as I hope you would bring me relief in my sorrow  To relive that moment of old  Perhaps, a spark can form – again.  Upon which a seed of love can bud – again
