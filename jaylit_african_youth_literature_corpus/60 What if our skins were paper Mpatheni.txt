What if our skins were paper?     What if our skins were paper?  Would it be a marvellous canvas?  Priceless to the eye, a wonder that we once lived.  Would it be that the ink would finally sink in?  Leaking all over our blood and veins  So that no story and no trial is left in vain  Would we become books to each other?  But books without words,  Just alphabetical scars carrying our narratives  Protecting it just like it has never left our bones bare?  Would our lovers beg to be pens?  So that they cannot only write our romance, but to be it,  To soak it up, just like we soak up the sun  Every inch of who we are catching the sunbeam  Would our wrinkles be something we accept?  Something that we can laugh at, be proud of,  Something that adds in this lie of withering away.  Would our colours, our unmatchable pigmentation, be a symbol?  A symbol that, somehow, God is more creative than what we think?
