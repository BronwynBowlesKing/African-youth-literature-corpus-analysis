Blessings      “Blessings”, the curse to the negligent and thorns of pain to the weary, but this was God’s will. A true blessing in disguise, unmistaken yet very much troubling to a social and economic leper as such is the standard of misguided prestige. Eat or be eaten, survive or be decimated. Victim preys on victim, the strong have decaying morals, and the poor are beyond help with wishful thinking but for one woman, one Queen. “The Mother of all Theresas” had it all figured out. She understood that you are only sick and labelled an outcast by the same shadows that seek amplification and approval from the dysfunctional forces of the world.   Being poor was another thing, but caring for something beyond help was fruitless, and a waste of resources for which people would scorn her. Prostitution is one of the oldest professions undoubtedly, but it became worryingly famous and normal, even above death itself. Young girls, weak parents, “devil in the dollars”, cried a blind old fool once upon a time, but the world only listens to those it deems fit to see and acknowledge.   She was the only person who understood how to endure pain to the core. Born and bred in a family of ten siblings and countless other bastard children, she had to learn to survive quickly because clearly Africa had already victimized her childhood necessities at a tender age as the firstborn. Her father was the commander of the local drunkards’ militia and brothel mafia. The mother was a formidable shebeen queen herself, the front runners if ever there was a beer and infidelity contest! Who could blame them? Poverty alone is the worst addiction ever! For those born telling it, the struggle every day is to sober up by enhancing your life through prayer and hard work, but for those that love shortcuts and ecstasy, the serenades in a bottle of beer seem to be equally satisfying! It was clearly up to her to wear the family pants.  Tough as it was, she tried her best even though it meant her losing a bit of herself in the process. On 23 February, she had just turned eighteen and her father was drunk and her mom out as usual. The most painful thing wasn’t what happened that day, but the reaction she got from her mother as she sought her love, consolation and guidance! The head of the house. Her own father, her guide had violated her in the worst possible way, and no one cared! Her siblings were too young to understand, and daddy to them was a hero with all the cheap and sun-burnt candy he used to get them.   “How could he?” she pondered on a pile of blood-stained sheets and shredded undergarments, but the deed was done, and again the devil had robbed her of something sacred and important. “God doesn’t care!” she would scream and shout in the cold showers she took. It was all vain, she conceded. She didn’t go to school at all, but she was clever enough to love listening to the radio.   The new start center! “HIV/AIDS!” “STIs” and “STDs” she used to hear, but she never fully understood it, although she knew she had to get to one of those “hospital places”, as she used to call it.   Positive! She tested positive! Five times the test was done to curb any disbelief, but the outcome was vigorously unsympathetic. It was a very sad and soul-killing day for her. Her own father was the result of this unprecedented eventuality. In anger, she vowed to kill him and her mother, but her conscience couldn’t let her. At one point she picked a strong rope around the haystacks of a nearby house in a feat to hang herself, but again she just couldn’t see it through. What was wrong with her? Why her? Why, God? She would cry sorrowfully alone on the concrete floor in her room that she shared with five of her younger sisters. Pregnant! A baby boy! No! She bellowed. It was incest at its worst form, but she had a choice to make. Abort the baby or keep it as a blessing from God as all children are! The answer in her affliction was simple; she was going to abort the baby!   And so to the toilet or bush it was, as is the custom of the “life dumpers”. It was a matter of when, where, and how she thought, but no one must know or see her for this could mean jail time if she was caught. So, she chose the Sabbath day out of all the days to commit this horrendous act! The idea was to wait after everyone was gone, and then consume the abortion pills, and the rest would take its natural course she thought! But God is not mocked! That day her aunt from the neighboring urban town came to visit and therefore no one went to church for they were waiting for her.        That day was all good vibes, and the traditional family bonding laughs here and there to signify appreciation to a splendid meal and important company. In the hardcore black community, I mean raw to the core black, the belief is that you can get away with anything, and the victims will cry foul and default in spirit, but with pregnancy, no one can hide the unbidden! The aunt could see it in the change in her complexion, and she immediately asked to have a word with her to “catch up on things”.  “What happened? Whose is it? When was it? Have you told your parents? What are we going to do with it?” These questions were like a wrecking ball that came mercilessly running back and forth to crush her little wall of confidence, modesty and life she had. She stammered! Not sure how to answer back her aunty; tears began to flood all over her face and eyes.   “He... Dad... Mom doesn’t… The family doesn’t…” she began sobbing heavily, and her aunt comforted her and told her babies are God’s burden and His most beloved, so she should be of good cheer for this was the beginning of great things to come. Little did the aunt know of what had been done, taken and broken away from her niece.   So the night ended, with spirits mended and pain tended for a time. That night she slept in the crowded kitchen-turned-guestroom with her aunty, and they chatted all night long. Finally, someone who cared and loved her and saw her for more than a deprived and weak girl she thought. It seemed fitting that she tells someone about the horrors she had faced the past couple of weeks and so she did without holding back any details. You would think that in such a day and age, people are less cultural and morally stiff like in old times, but humanity is still a farfetched occurrence. Again she was labelled a liar and a stupid girl and told by her aunt, the one she trusted most, to go do the dirty dishes that mirrored her actions.   “Life is truly unfair!” she thought. Evil had torn and thrashed the zealous to be touched, but no good was going to save anyone this time like in the movies. It was just too much, so she went to bed that night in her usual room with her little sisters and kissed all of them goodbye and told them to always stick together and that she loves them more than anything in the world. Weeping and in all forms of pain, she cried deeply in a heart-to-heart moment with her young sisters, but she knew that midnight was almost upon her and that was her getaway time. Two small taxi-bags and a satchel that had seen better days were all she needed to carry all her belongings, and so she sneaked out whilst everyone was asleep and began her journey to a world without a name.      To the city of “Mecca”, land of giants and spaghetti roads. She smiled as she strode along the dusty and stony road of her village post office. But only the dark of the night alluded to her opinions, and the community dogs barked her grief to existence every time she passed a neighbor’s house. She was truly alone, afraid and in a dark place but her will was strong and set.   Mecca was going to be her new chance to live, a fresh breath and a lifetime distraction from her dysfunctional family. It was a land made for the dreamers, a place of opportunity, the arena of peace for those truly sun-kissed by pain and tranquillity. Jobs were aplenty, the people were ridiculously friendly, and love was real. She could almost taste it and feel it in the air, she thought as she strode along. However, mornings and dawn are built on the unexpected and unthinkable.  Sometimes wishes do come true, and sometimes it’s unexplainable how the brain constructs such deep and awful illusions as she found out. Morning set in! And the Mecca she had read about in books was nowhere to be found. The dust road seemed to be even worse along this side of the area; there were dense marshes with countless thorny shrubs and a lot of goats and sheep. Being born and living all your life in the rural area surely has its demerits as she found out. In this area was a small, neighboring rural town close to where she used to live. However, she had never gone beyond her village’s borders, so this was uncharted territory for her. Hunger and thirst were upon her, therefore, she went to a nearby borehole and drank some water and washed her face a bit to refresh herself, for it was morning.      “Phew!” she sighed as she took in the surroundings around her and sat down beneath an oak tree. The area seemed a bit remote compared to her village, it felt like a horror scene where only the main actor survives, and the rest are victims during the length of the movie. All of a sudden, she heard a faint corresponding movement – it had the sound of a woodpecker digging into a tree trunk. It was all too common not to notice and feel, as was the sound of her empty belly!   She could try to sneak into a nearby farm and steal some sugar cane and watermelon to curb her hunger, she thought. So the plan was put to motion. The first step was obviously to carry her belongings and place them at a hidden place in case she had to run away depending on the success of the plan. The second step was to check if the farm wire was electrical or razor wire in which case she could use a blanket to place over it and cross over unhurt. Lastly, dogs and guards were the tricky part, but out of all the things her parents had done to her, they had made an exceptional athletic girl child. Boy, could she run! There was this one time when she was sixteen years old where she outran two local and prestigious male sprinters in her area for the prize of a heifer during the village chief’s inauguration.  Realistically, she could breeze past any threat as long as she had a steady distance to get into her stride. So she went nicodemously in search of a target farm, and as fate would have it, she found one after just walking for a kilometer. The sign at the entrance point showed that the farm was called Herod’s Farm, and by the looks of it, it belonged to a wealthy owner. Everything was evergreen, the livestock full of fat and the infrastructures where all built with a taste of unique modernity. It was the farm of dreams for any man who dared to dream agriculturally.   Quickly! Before she was seen, she executed her plan with significant focus and speed. “One, two”, she sang in her aurora of thieving brilliance, it was just too easy, like she was born for this art, but something was awfully wrong! Unbeknown to her, prior to her entrance to the farm, some herdsmen had seen her by the community borehole from afar drinking water and had chosen to follow this “stranger” as it was custom to familiarize with newcomers and strangers to the community. So as she was in her element of cutting the sugar cane, she suddenly felt quick and loud steps coming towards her, but as she tried to run away, something hard and heavy knocked her on the head!      In her dream, she was queen and had everything she had ever wanted. Gold, vines, land, milk, honey and joyful servants – she surely was the best as her kingdom sang melodies of her graciousness and greatness. But this was before the real pain set in, and reality blew the fantasy mist away!   She woke up in pain with a bandage on her head and her belongings next to her. Her first reaction was to try and wake up and instinctively run again, but she had taken such a hard hit that had drained her of all her reserves; therefore, she fainted again. She woke up again to the noise and eyes of a very large crowd. For an area that looked remote, the number of people around at this point was quite shocking. Looking at the people circled around her, she felt like a wounded animal ready to be given its last gasps of air before the slaughter. She was very afraid and overwhelmed with embarrassment. It was a norm that whenever a thief was caught, the community had to see the thief and shame him or her using the legal channels of the gathering crowd’s speech and opinions on the thief’s suitable punishment.   The village head then finally spoke after what seemed like hours of torcher. “Who are you, and why are you here to cause discomfort in our community?!” he asked. Lost for words and a little bit jaded, she mustered the strength to stand up and talk to them for the first time ever since she arrived!   “I am a young lady, eighteen years of age, from a village that is close to this one, and I am an orphan,” she said with so much conviction that even the idiom of crocodile tears would have had emotional and watery eyes. The crowd was moved at this revelation, especially the orphans and widows in their midst, who knew the core struggles of being alone in a world that never shows mercy. Finally, the farm owner stood up as the crowd was mumbling and rumbling about what to do with the young “orphan” thief!   “I am Herod, the owner of this farm that this young lady trespassed and violated against, I beg that the crowd listens and conjures to my suggestion”, he said. “As the victim in this matter, my ruling was going to be very severe if it was a case of a mob venture or if the perpetrator had a family to liaise and commune with. But as we have all heard, she is an orphan; hence I declare that she works at my farm for six months as compensation for the damage she has done.”   These words were met with massive positive support. Thus the council adhered to the farm owner’s wishes, for he was among the most powerful and influential people in the whole community.   So she was to be Herod’s servant for six months, but this wasn’t so bad compared to the devils she left behind, she pondered in her mind. She was actually happy about her fate, for once. At least in this land, no one knew her or could harm her like had been done to her by her family. As the days rolled along, she began to understand and learn new things at the farm. Even the farm owner began to notice how she was fast and intelligent at learning things and that was very appealing in many ways to him. No one saw her as the thief that came with rags and a funny looking bag anymore after some time, she had even made friends, and was happy and free at last. But as the time was nearing its end for her service at the farm, she didn’t want to leave anymore, for the benefits at the farm were visible on the health and well-being of everyone who worked there. So she made a plan which could cost her greatly, or benefit her greatly if she was successful. As her pregnancy progressed, she wondered about the advantage that might be in her grasp.      It was customary and a traditional belief that a pregnant woman was to be relieved and exempt of all duties, especially if she was suspected and expected to carry a boy child, a father’s investment and legacy bearer. Usually, a lady would have been relieved of her duties three to four months before childbirth, but she decided she was not willing to reveal the pregnancy yet, especially considering its cause. So she devised another plan.   Herod’s son had just returned home from foreign education and life-enhancing expeditions across the globe, and he was a very likeable person. Obviously, he was a level above and beyond her in terms of class and in the social pecking order of the community, but this town boy had one weakness, his power to bend his father’s will.   In all his life, Herod had one child and two wives, and his child was pampered like a prince. The boy grew, breathed and even dreamt royalty. But like his father, he found it hard to get children, despite being in his early thirties and married for five years. It must have been an unfortunate hereditary issue, but he always cried and begged to God for a son and better days. Things were hard for him and his wife and their love suffered a dip occasionally when he was drunk as he would blame his wife for being barren and evil for their lack of children.   Awkwardly enough, the girl thief and Herod’s son became close as he was a huge fan of humor and sport, and she was an expert in these. She never told anyone about her pregnancy or wore tight and revealing clothes. Being a clever girl, she made baggy clothes a trademark and her own form of style that seemed well suited to her, as other workers would compliment her. She knew that only Herod’s son could talk to his father about extending her stay at the farm, so she had to convince him first. She waited for him near the threshold, as usual, for a chat and a game of checkers. “What happened to your mother, my friend?” she asked as she took two of his pieces easily.   “She died giving birth to me years ago,” he said, as he took two of her pieces with a grin and fake smile. Seeing that this was an emotional subject to him, she pressed even more.   “I was happy once, born in a good family and free, but now I have no one and no family.”  “The days are near for my exit dear friend, but know that I have had the best time of my life over the past few months!” There was dead silence for a bit until the game was finally over and he won for the first time for she threw the game purposefully.   He was gutted at the reality and words of his friend, for indeed she was about to leave, and who knows, maybe she was to be gone forever. Surely, if he had a say to it, he could help and rescue the situation he thought.   So he asked her bluntly with a straight and serious face, “The only way you will be able to stay here is if you agree to become my second wife and I convince my father of this development.” This didn’t shock her at all for she knew the politics of culture and realized the benefits that could come with this for her and her unborn child. Therefore, she agreed because she knew him and they were friends, so it would be simple to get along as a couple, she thought.   So Herod’s son went to talk with his father about the new development, and Herod disagreed vehemently. His argument was based on the shame it would bring upon the family if his son took a known outsider who came into their home as a thief, despite being like family now. It was a taboo and an insult to Herod, and he was infuriated by this. For days they argued and debated, basing it on personal and public opinions, and finally Herod’s son stuck to his decision, even when he knew his father didn’t support him.  However, Herod was a shrewd and stern man when it comes to his beliefs and opinions, and he could not have this at all. Thus he disowned his son, sending him away, including the thief, to fend for themselves, since he didn’t oblige to his father’s will.   And so for friendship and love, Herod’s son lost it all, and because of culture and public opinion, Herod lost his son to a stranger’s cause.   At daybreak the following day, she was woken up by Herod’s son with instructions to pack her belongings and prepare to go away for they had failed to reason with Herod. She was shocked by this revelation and saddened by what her situation had done to Herod’s son and his wife. But this was far from over, for in fact, she had a new enemy lurking and breathing up close to her in the form of Melody, Herod’s daughter-in-law. She had lost it all because of a village girl who she thought wanted to destroy her marriage and peace.      Chapter 7    So to the road they made their way, to a journey far abroad the horizon, to the city of lights, town life as Herod’s son instructed his two wives. He had a house that he had bought long ago when he had made his first pay as a professional mathematics teacher. It wasn’t a big house, it could barely fit two people with its dwarf bedroom, kitchen and sitting room, but the situation needed it to accommodate three livelihoods with the potential of an extra body later on. So they walked and walked to the bus stop that was very far from Herod’s farm, taking moments to catch their breath and relax a bit.   Melody didn’t speak to her no matter how she tried to make small talk with her for the journey was long and begged for the vocally blessed to take center stage. Ten… twenty... thirty kilometers, the journey seemed not to end, and if ever its toll could be shown to anyone for illustrative purposes, Melody’s face would be a Picasso of it. Born to the town and city life, she was used to gliding past mileage through the comforts of a car and vast city buses, but this phase in her life was the worst thing she had ever felt and experienced. She was happy when she was married to Herod’s son at first, having the best of the city life for the first four years of their marriage as her husband had to finish his studies.   However, this year was the real devil in Prada for her. They had to relocate to the rural area because Herod’s son had been culturally instructed by his elders to come, talk and stay in the land of his ancestors for a time if he ever wanted to have kids, for his situation was a traditional one. So they left everything, her friends, her blood family, the milk-and-honey lifestyle, for a cause that didn’t even succeed because of a village girl. Herod was the owner of the big house they used to live in before, but being disowned meant that Herod’s son had to find and stay at his own house. Finally, they arrived at the bus stop and boarded a bus to a city that had its own good times and edgy moments. They arrived eventually to town, looking like mud house builders who have never taken a bath. For those that knew Melody and her husband before, this sight would have been quite a picture for the comedy archives. Dirt was all over their faces, hair, clothes and shoes but the thing with hardships is that you lose the care and damn at a certain point for life itself, for everything will seem the same whether good or bad.   For the “village thief”, this experience was like the best thing that can happen to a human being during his or her lifetime. The city had huge lights compared to their village fires, the people smelled nice and looked fresh. Buildings were astonishing; she even saw the town hall that had a clock with a bell that made so much noise like a gong they had to alarm them of village meetings. This was the real life; she could feel it in her veins.   After almost forty-five minutes, they arrived at the house, and it looked like a giant spider web of grass and wields wanted to rip it apart. Immediately they went in and took chronological showers with the village girl being the last to bath. When they were done, they went to prepare a meal at the kitchen, but Melody said since she was in charge, she would cook tomorrow, so it was up to the village thief to step up for the day. She agreed peacefully with the idea that maybe Melody would be at least dealing with the situation outside, in the yard but Melody was relaxing on the old and dusty sofas they had with Herod’s son, who was too tired to even open his eyes. This made her a bit angry for she was used to the workaholic nature of rural women, but life had surely introduced her to the laziest person she had ever seen, she thought, as she made pap and the beef stew. They ate like cannibals at a free meat festival because hunger had oppressed them since they had boarded the bus to the city.  She was too tired to attend the bad situation outside, so she decided to wash the plates and sleep so that she could deal with it early in the morning. However, because the bed was small, and there was no way Melody would budge, she had no choice but to sleep on the floor      Chapter 8    “Krukuuu... Krukuuu”, sang the early birds. It was morning, a new day for a new endeavor, activity and adventure. She woke up to the discomfort of the concrete floor and dirty carpet. The yard first! She arose in high spirits and smiling. Finally, she was in town, a place full of opportunities and unlimited possibilities for those who dared to dream above and beyond. At first, she removed the weeds and blackjacks all over the place and raked the yard. Then she swept it and cleaned the whole house whilst Melody and their husband were asleep. Funnily enough, she was the one pregnant, but because she kept it secret, no mercy was shown to her and Melody was the worst. The day passed along with Herod’s son going out to look for a job.  Melody had a catching up session with her gossipful and judgmental friends that looked at the village thief like an alien out of space. To them, she looked like a maid that wore oversized and bad looking clothes. She totally felt out of place at her new home with them present. However, she was strong and not easily moved; therefore, she distanced herself from them and pruned the small mango trees.   The next day was more of the same, their husband was job searching while Melody went out with her friends, and she was left alone to tend to the house that nobody really wanted or loved. On the third day, she wanted to do something different too, to go out and see the city. Therefore she tagged along with her husband, which Melody didn’t like, but she did it anyway. To town they went and boy did she love it. He bought her some toiletries, panties and new clothes, which she was very grateful for.   However, Melody’s grocery bag was significantly smaller compared to hers, and this made her afraid of the disagreements and quarrels that could arise from this because Melody was very jealous and spiteful. They spent the whole day shopping with the little reserves that Herod’s son had left.   She also wanted to find a job and assist the family as she knew that their husband would have a hard time sustaining and providing for both of them. So she asked her husband to assist her to look for a job, but he jokingly told her that people in town don’t hire chubby women because it is a sign of riches and wellbeing. Perhaps he could see the big secret hidden under her garments, but she was a natural master of disguise and she kept her cool. Still, no one knew the truth.      Chapter 9    As they approached the gate to their house, she could almost feel the change in mood. Alone with her husband, they had the most epic times and picture-perfect moments. But as soon as Melody was around, everything went stale. She unpacked the groceries in the kitchen, taking huge care not to touch nor break the first wife’s gifts. Melody was in a very jovial mood, she had spent the day with her friends and young sister that looked like a customized mini version of her.   There was no mistaking the fact that they shared the same blood for she was also loud-mouthed and over-confident like her older sister. In African tradition, elders systematically and periodically send a spy in the form of a close relative or family member to check on the livelihood and health of their blood children. If things are good, the relative generalizes the report back home in as normal and expected a way as possible.   However, if there are unprecedented and alarming changes that directly oppress and depress their family member, urgent change and family meetings are held up with the in-laws to address any queries and discomfort. In this case, nothing was rosy or worth the ululations that many had spent effort perfecting during Herod’s son and Melody’s wedding.   It was a broad daylight disaster, and a daily fiasco as the sister-in-law was briefed and vividly indoctrinated by Melody. She had the same hate and look that Melody showed the village thief, but hers was deeper. Herod’s son was happy to see his young sister-in-law but was also aware of her intended visit. The village girl, on the other hand, had no hole or place to hide because if Melody’s company alone felt like a nightmare, that of two Melody’s would surely feel like the last nail in a coffin. She was very shaken by this eventuality and reality. When she tried being modest and respectful by greeting Melody’s young sister, the sister-in-law asked her if she was the new maid or was she looking for a piece job. Being a wife without true dignity and belonging was very sad and unfair, but this was just the beginning of a series of pure evil and inhumane acts by the two sisters.   After they had eaten some supper, their husband tried to cool the air and properly introduce her to his sister-in-law but he wasn’t ready for the outcome that followed. The sister-in-law didn’t waste time with false pleasantries and politeness, she scorned the husband on why he had taken another wife and let alone a village girl. He tried to defend his decision, but Melody’s younger sister was a trainee lawyer; thus, it was a flawless victory to her even before the debate began. If the neighborhood had to testify of the noise they had heard, they would have sworn that Herod’s son was being bullied and abused by these women because they were speaking over him openly with no holds barred. Tempers were very high, evil thoughts lurking and chaos not very afar off.   As the sister-in-law and her brother-in-law were going at it word-to-word, Melody took the opportunity to attack the village girl. She cursed her and kept shoving her head against the wall, and that was enough for the village girl. For someone who was negatively looked upon and ill-treated, she wasn’t a cheeky or violent person, but that day was made for action classics.   She rose up in one quick step, motion and thunder slapped Melody against the old sitting room sofa. Melody fell crushingly hard on the long sofa. Melody fainted, and everyone was in shock for the echo of that slap could have blindly fooled a believer to be similar to the sound that the walls of Jericho made when they fell to the trumpets of Israel. It was epic and loud, even the neighbors came over to see if the local electrical transformer had blown or something had fallen out of the ever pouring sky for the sound and noise had been heard all over.   The sister-in-law was quick to call the police and ambulance, and Herod’s son had just frozen from all of these events. It was astonishing how a good day can go from a plus ten to a quick minus ten. He was short for words, but he had to man-up quickly and find his tongue because the police were on their way, and so was the ambulance. This had escalated way too far, and it was not a private family matter anymore. Even a local journalist and neighbor was present to see and assess what had taken place.      Chapter 10    “What happened here? Who provoked who? Who hit who? And why? What were the others doing whilst this was happening?” asked the detective. It already felt like a courtroom for the perpetrators. A large mob had gathered around their homestead to be the local judge and jury if the police dared to entice their ever biased and complicated conclusions. “This imbecile began everything, and she is the one who hit my sister with that metal pot on the head and cheek!” said Melody’s younger sister with fury and rage all over her face. If lies had a color, these would be green indeed for these were beyond the common white lies that people do tell from time to time. But Melody’s younger sister didn’t care about what her statement and claim had on the village girl’s future. This was a huge crime, especially in the big city where the law was as strict and harsh as a grandmother’s distaste for young girls’ bad morals.   Realistically, it could mean about a year in jail, depending on the severity of the injuries suffered by the victim and the evidence against the accused. The toughest test now was literacy and composure. Unfortunately for the village girl, the police had sent a white lady detective that had zero tolerance for the disjointed vernacular speech that she was about to say.   Melody’s younger sister was born and bred in the city and was very sharp in her control of the English language. She manipulated the situation quickly because she knew the village girl needed some interpretation, to say the least, in order to understand the serious case she was now in.   Seeing and feeling the judgmental air that was being breathed by the multitude gathered around, she finally thought about words to say back. “She talk talk… push push my head, and I boom boom once on the cheek,” she said as she used gestures to showcase the highlights of what had transpired. The crowd laughed their hats off, this girl had just spoken Greek in a Colosseum of pure blood and radical Romans.   She was outnumbered and out favored completely, but she had one card to play. Herod’s son had been surprisingly quiet all this time as if he wasn’t getting involved at all. He was scared of his name and face appearing on the local newspaper and news bulletin on TV for his nemesis journalist neighbor was also present among the crowd taking notes and gathering data. But this wasn’t the time for selfishness or personal prestige. Someone had done ill to someone else, and unfortunately someone got violated through all of this.   Definitely, the jail cells were cringing in delight for their next victim to close in but who was it going to be? Asked by the police about the whole situation, Herod’s son became Judas! He claimed that he and his sister-in-law were in a different room talking and catching up when they heard the sound that the neighborhood had heard. It was like Melody, even in her temporary unconscious state, was the puppeteer, and everyone else was her puppets. Even though unconscious, she was winning.   So the police hand-cuffed the village girl for further questioning at the police station whilst Melody was being strapped to a sleeping bed by the medics in their van. As this was happening, Melody suddenly woke up as they were about to put her lifeless body in the car.   “Stop! It’s all a huge misunderstanding,” said Melody as they were about to shove the criminal inside the police vehicle opposite the hospital van. It was both a miracle and very confusing what had just transpired.  The hater had turned over a new leaf in a few hours just because of a personal hand to hand with “the intruder”.   Everyone turned their attention to the patient who had just woken up from an apparent slumber. She didn’t look jaded or seriously hurt in any way physically, but her ego was bruised. What hurt her the most was that she lost a fight in her own home where she thought all the odds favored her the most. Life was truly a learning curve, Melody thought. She was married to a weak man, she finally realized.   As much as the perpetrator was wrong, her husband was also as wrong as she was. It tore her apart internally every time she would look at the picture frames of good times that would never be found again. She had a choice: to be patient and maneuver her plan personally or let the police deal with the “village problem” as she termed her. But pain had taught her to be attentive and, most importantly, to take revenge when the tide was silent, and the winds were calm. “There shall be no case against this woman, I just fell and fainted, that’s all,” Melody said.   Everyone was shocked by this. How could she even say those words? Melody’s sister was still furious at her! The police tried to convince her to open a docket against the village thief, but she played it down and withdrew the case. It was a waste of time and energy, the police felt, and left. And so did the ambulance. The mob was still in disbelief, especially the journalist because this was new to him. He tried to get a scoop from Melody because such stories make big news and huge money, but Melody bluntly told him to never set foot again in her house. This seemed amusing and amazing to Herod’s son, he loved what Melody had done and said so. But a big pot was boiling, and the only ingredient left to be added was the meat.   Someone had to die, Melody thought. It was the only way out of all of this, and she wanted to do it personally to make sure it played out as she wanted to have it. It would begin with her saving the second wife from going to jail then she would act nicely and very lovable to everyone. When they relax, Lord have mercy on them, for I will become death, the eater of worlds, she consented with a devilish grin. Her sleep was long enough for her to come to this sudden and insane conclusion, but her mind was made up.   The only thing left was time and for her to put a patient siege over her prey and victim to be. If only the victim knew that their days were numbered, she looked at the skies for a shooting star as if to wish upon it and seek support but the night was a very dark one. And so the thief was safe, the sister-in-law mad, Herod’s son ashamed and embarrassed, but Melody was very calm and cool. She insisted that they all forget about this day and pray as a family about it and that her sister should accept the second wife as her sister too. It was awkward, everyone thought she was insane and that the fall might have done more damage to her than people thought, but they listened to her demands for they were all trying to cater and care for her as prescribed by the medics.      Chapter 11    “Is everything okay, big sis’?” asked Melody’s younger sister. She still couldn’t believe what had happened the previous day. Of all the people she knew, her big sis was never the one to forgive and forget easily. At one point when they were younger, she used to revenge so much at everyone who trespassed against her that they called her “the wave” because of her assurance of ill will. But as they grew up, she had matured and became the role model her younger sister never thought she would be. Melody replied her calmly and intellectually.   “Once upon a time, there was a queen called Cleopatra, a golden jewel of Egypt, deepest pits of beauty! She lived well and suffered as history alludes, but what I like about her is how she handled her hardships. With patience and calm young sis! You see, true pain and vengeance lie on the impact of the evil brought upon, but death goes beyond. Death brings forth tears and sadness, but necessary death brings upon a new era, new life, fresh air, eternal peace,” Melody said with a cold dark stare at her sister. Her young sister had never seen this side of her; she was afraid of her and yet felt her pain and guile desires. Melody’s words left her with one question to verify something.   “Who do you need gone Melody and how and when?” asked her young sister.   “Herod’s son will not make me conceive any children, and the village girl has been a thorn in my life ever since we met her,” said Melody.   “We are not getting any younger, and we come from a family of black ships that have cut across currents all the time,” added her young sister.   There was silence for a bit between them as they both felt the pain of being brought up under a roof where they were viewed as investments and baby-makers! Born and bred by the orphanage, their parents had abandoned them at a tender age, and despite being adopted by their foster ones, who showed periodic love to them, they had to survive and push through the misfortunes and unfairness rubbed upon their faces daily by their foster siblings. Growing up wasn’t a trap to them as many people usually cry, but it was freedom and peace finally. However, the last few months reminded Melody of all the pain and unfairness that she and her sister had suffered when they grew up.  Their biological mother had left them a book called The Passage to a Human’s Heart the day she went rogue on them. In the book, there was a section about mushrooms that Melody was very keen about. She loved mushrooms and so did her husband because it was the thing she knew how to cook better than anyone else. The book stated the basics of how to cook mushrooms and serve them, but they also gave something more, an idea and yes, a precaution!   Mushrooms are good for high blood pressure, proteins and boosting the immune system, but the bad ones kill very sorrowfully. Melody knew this very well, and she knew how to pick the right ones and leave away the deadly ones. However, in this case, she wanted a “killer dish”. Food that would literally fulfil and yet destroy both the body and soul. So the plan was to commit murder through the nourishing and finer things in life, food! She told her young sister of her plan, and she was very shocked. Hate alone was fulfilling enough for the young sister, but this was beyond her capacity as a human being. At first, she was lost for words, but she finally mastered the power to speak her mind out.  “For me, this is too much big sister, I think you have to stop it right now, we can always leave if it’s that bad,” she said. But Melody had already packed her bags because she knew how her young sister would react, and she understood her concern, but this was no arena for mercy.   A lot was at stake and Melody knew that she couldn’t risk involving her young sister on her devious plan, so they hugged it out and cried together as they said their goodbyes. The young sister cried the most because she knew this could be an end to many things, but she couldn’t do anything about it because she had promised Melody, the only blood relative she had in the world, not to say anything to anyone. She said her goodbyes to her brother-in-law and even to the village girl who looked fatter than ever before. In her heart and mind, she was torn apart because she was an indirect accomplice to a potential murder, and this could spoil her law career, among other things.   However, she understood that there are things that only family can do for family, and this was that time. So finally Melody was left with her husband and the other wife and that day was her turn to cook a meal that she promised everybody would like because, so she said, it was from the heart.          Chapter 12    If you were to compare something deeply, really compare, then this dish was top chef material. The aroma alone would have anyone who smelled it breathing huskily with hunger. It was the good food that wishers wine and dine on with their eyes and imagination on TV shows but never got to ever taster personally. Everybody was filled with anticipation for supper. The village girl even assisted in the serving of the food because her hunger levels had gone up a notch since she was eating for two. Prayer was the only thing left before everybody dug in with their forks and knives, and their husband offered to bless the food.   “Dear Lord, as we are about to eat, may we take every bite with gratitude and always remember that nourishment comes from above and within, we are sinners, evildoers but through your mercy we re-live a life in the hope and faith that we are doing and living a Christian life and that you will always stand with us, thank you, Jesus, thank you Father, in the name of Christ our Lord, amen!”   “Amen,” everybody said. But Melody was crying silently as her husband was praying. She said it was tears of joy when they asked her, but that prayer reminded her of all the evil she had done in the hours prior to dinner.  Things had escalated quickly, and the deed was done. The poisonous mushrooms were served to one plate in particular. It was evil at its worst, but it was a necessary evil, she reassured herself. Only one spoon was enough to make her plan a success. She had carefully placed the plates so that her victim would surely pick the plate. The village girl and her husband were oblivious to the situation at hand. One of them was about to die painfully, but who was it?  The village girl was Melody’s nemesis in reality. She was pregnant and also HIV positive, although she didn’t disclose this to anyone until now. After the prayer, she asked for a word before they eat, and they sat up attentively to listen to her.   “As you know, I indeed told you that I am an orphan and that I come from a village far and abroad in the veld and mountains. But I have never told you my real story, the real reason I came to your father’s farm from the beginning!” Her words took everybody aback and they became seriously attentive. They were listening to another episode of more drama, Melody thought, but even she wasn’t ready for the news to come.   “My father raped me and made me HIV positive. I am the firstborn of the king and queen of cheap liquor and poverty itself. My mother didn’t believe me when I told her about what dad had done, nor did my aunt. I was labelled a liar and a disappointment in my family, and that tore me apart.   The day I came to your father’s farm was the day after I ran away from all of the abuse and drama in my life. I didn’t mean to involve my problems in your lives and bring hardships into your home, but I was afraid, hurt and in need of help. I know I don’t deserve your remorse, love and forgiveness, but I couldn’t keep it any further from you seeing that I am pregnant with a child conceived out of forced incest!” After her words, there was dead silence.  Herod’s son finally understood why she would avoid any sexual advances he made under the pretense of saying they had to have a white wedding at first. This was a person who was not only damaged to the core, but she was broken in ways beyond the normal. Of course, she had her flaws as a human being and young lady, but what her family did to her was typical “hell” material. She had conned them all to some degree, but you had to see for yourself to understand how deep this mess was.   Melody finally got it why this girl was very unusual and jumpy sometimes. She had hated her for so long that she had never even bothered to go deeper and ask her the real questions that matter like her lineage, among other things. Being born and suffering most of her life, she understood the village girl’s story completely. For the first time ever, she felt love towards her and pity. She went over and comforted her, and they both cried in each other’s arms. It was a very sensitive experience that only a woman can relate to another fellow lady in soul and mind. Melody felt her pain, and it made her cry even more because she had ill-treated a pregnant and abused woman, besides her deceit.   Everybody’s feelings were all over the place. Herod’s son also joined in the hug, and they prayed again, crying and laughing about how they all look ugly when they cry. After this revelation, they sat down to talk more and eat. Herod’s son took a bite, and so did the village girl. The food was amazing; they both thanked Melody, but Melody had suddenly turned pale with regret. The whole situation had made her have second thoughts, and just as she was about to take the plates away from them before they ate the poisonous mushrooms, they had quickly taken bites due to hunger and the time they had spent talking and comforting each other. Melody froze, and she was so regretful of her act, that a stroke hit her suddenly.      Chapter 13    She fell down on her chair, shaking all over the place. Herod’s son was shocked by this, but his masculine nerves kicked in, and he reacted fast to try and hold her and make sure she didn’t bite her tongue off because the stroke had left her totally incapable of controlling herself. But as they were focused on attending to Melody and calling an ambulance, Herod’s son felt a sharp cut and tingling feeling in his stomach, it was like something was stabbing him from the inside. He groaned and coughed out huge saliva of blood and chunks of what seemed like meat.   The village girl being the one on the phone in a feat to request an ambulance dropped the phone in disbelief. It was like her ancestors had cast a deep and dark voodoo spell on her every time she seemed to begin enjoying her life. At first, it was Melody, and now it was her husband shaking all over and spitting tons of saliva and blood all over.   She froze not able to contemplate or think straight. At her village, she had heard stories of people dying due to being poisoned, but this was real, and she couldn’t help but beg the earth to devour her also for this was too much. If she was to survive such an ordeal, surely she was going to be hanged or go to jail for life because no one was going to believe her. She could almost see the headlines stating that a homewrecker kills two in a feat to take claim of everything. This was reality waiting to unveil itself, she thought.   As she was busy thinking, panicking and speaking in hieroglyphics to the telephone attendant, she could feel both her husband and Melody exchanging screams of pain, groans and bubbles of saliva. It felt like two volcanos had erupted at the same time, and no one could stop the carnage that they were coughing out. She managed to convey her message and the telephone attendant finally got what she was saying. But as she was screaming and shouting for them to hurry, only one person was left coughing and groaning. Melody had suddenly gone quiet. The village girl panicked even more.  She noticed that Melody’s head had expanded a bit due to the stroke. You could still see the smile she always had as she lay there, beautiful, wide-eyed and quiet. It was as if she was cut short by some supernatural phenomenon before she could say what she wanted to say for her eyes were fixed at the village girl, but her mouth was closed and full of blood-stained saliva. She had died out of the guilt of her own actions.   To hell or heaven? Only God knew, but one thing became certain to her in a sudden revelation: Melody wanted to murder one of them. The village girl began to play back the moments prior to this incident, and it was sad that the people she was laughing with and talking to a few minutes ago were both laying down with one dead and the other fighting for his life.   She cried and screamed, calling for help from her neighbors, but no one heard her because there was a loud celebration nearby with powerhouse musicians and classic bands. Most of the locals had gone there to attend this rare occasion.   She even thought of telling Herod’s son to shut up in order for her to tell him that Melody had died – her mind was all over the place. But what would it have achieved for he was in a battle for his own life? He cried and groaned in pain as the poison continued to cut him through and through all over his internal body parts.   Finally, he took one last gasp, and that was it. The village girl was mortified and didn’t believe what was happening. She thought that it was just a bad dream, so she pinched herself hard and the reality of what had just happened began to set in. Two corpses were laying down on her feet, two people whom she had been judged to have disturbed and brought about ill will and intentions to their peace and home. It was a classic story for the gossip columns and communal haters.   She cried uncontrollably as she closed both her husband and Melody’s eyes. The ambulance was on its way, but it was too late. She knew that her fate was sealed because there was no way she was going to survive the bias scrutiny of the entire community and let alone the police that had intended to arrest her in the first place.   Looking at the dining table and the food still laid down there, she wondered if the plate that Herod’s son had taken was really made for him or her. However, as the scripture postulates, let the dead tend to the dead and the living to the living but in the village girl’s case, she had no one to ask or share opinions with. One bite would seal the deal she thought.  No one would know what had truly happened if she too was in the land of the dead. At one point, she thought of running away, but she was eight months and two weeks pregnant, she knew it would be a slow death either way because she wouldn’t get far without being caught and that would have made matters even worse for her than they were right now. So she took a pen and paper and did as most suicides do, writing down a letter.    Dear unborn child, I am your mother and I love you so much. You will hear so many stories about me, and most of them will be unpleasant, but the truth is that I tried my best to do right by everyone. I know you are going to grow and be a champion and have the world chanting at your feet with success. It’s funny how I picture you with a strong jawline and brown hazelnut eyes. Many hearts are going to be broken surely with your charm and good looks. But remember to be real and methodic always and to never be like your father and granddad! You deserve to know the truth about who he was, but as a mother, I would like you to know that your only father is the Lord in heaven, for that is as real as it gets. The papers will say I killed these people out of spite and jealousy, among other fabricated lies they can think of.     But the real story is that your older step-mom tried to poison me, but instead she unfortunately poisoned your stepdad by mistake. She died from a stroke and shock, and he died due to the severe poisoning. I never wanted to make the choice of leaving you before you were born, my child, but fate chose my destiny before I had a say in how my future would unfold. Your birthday is always going to be a marker of pain and grief, but be of good cheer, for your mom will always be with you in spirit and, when the times are tough, remember to pray always.     I was an athlete, can you imagine? Fast and powerful on the track but I hope you exceed and excel more than I did. Hopefully, you will have so many gifts and talents that you would have a hard time doing one thing at once. Education is key my child, I was poorly educated because my parents used to drink all my school fees away and never catered to my academic needs as a child, therefore, I was unfortunate. But I got a chance at redemption through you, to live and learn through you and be proud of the skills learnt and lessons appreciated. I love you, sweet child. To the foster parents that will have you, may the dear Lord bless them abundantly and increase their territory...     The mother that will hold and love you in spirit forever.    When she had finished writing this letter, she sealed it and placed it on the table close to the kitchen door where anyone coming in would see it. The plan was to hang herself when she heard the ambulance sirens getting closer so that she could die, but give a window for the medics to dissect her and save her baby.   Option two was to eat the poisoned meal and hope that they find it too late to save both her and the baby, thus making them choose to save one. She chose the second option and ate the poisoned mushrooms. At first, she felt numb and painless, maybe because she expected the experience to kick in at once. She was surprised at the feeling of it all. It was strangely normal at first. After some minutes, however, she started feeling woozy. Then it felt like a sudden rush of burning and stabbing sensations all over her body. She knew it had begun, and there was no turning back now.   As she positioned herself to the floor in pain next to the two human corpses, she began to reflect and relive her life again and again before the real pain and pool of blood and saliva took over. If she didn’t have HIV/AIDS, maybe she could have met the boy of her dreams and lived happily ever after. Life was unfair. Surely, if she didn’t go to Herod’s farm in the first place, everyone else would be still alive and happy, but people make their own choices and Melody had made the worst possible one for everybody.   She thought about her siblings, how they would grow up, and who would help them from the abuse and vulnerability at home. The future was undeniably bleak for them too, but it was too late. She had eaten of the forbidden, and judgement awaited her in body and soul. Finally, she began to convulse and roll over in pain as the first puddles of blood-stained saliva began to flow. She didn’t cry or groan at all like her husband and Melody had done because she actually believed this was better than living.   The ambulance arrived shortly, and then medics came speeding into the house with stretcher beds and what they found was shocking. Two lifeless bodies and one vibrating and rolling body bag of human saliva and blood. What a picture this was! They acted fast. They restrained her on a stretcher and carried her to the van, and then they called the police and forensics team to attend to the potential murders and crime scene. The ambulance was driven by a driver made for the Formula 1 arena, he was fast as lightning, and yet very steady with the wheel. Along the way, the vibrating and rolling continued although she was restrained and during all this process they gave her some injections and some anti-poison medicine to counter the poison inside her before it reached the baby.   But it seemed like it wasn’t working because, at some point, she faintly overheard the medics say that her kidneys were shutting down, and so were her lungs. Everyone was conformed consigned to the reality that she and the baby would not make it. In her mind, she was in a world of her own: peaceful, quiet and free. However, a voice came to her telling her that she had to go back and it wasn’t time yet. As she was asking whose voice it was, she saw Herod’s son and Melody smiling at her and telling her that it’s alright, her baby needs her, and so does her family!   Suddenly she awoke from her slumber to the reality of fighting for her life and that of her baby; she knew that she didn’t want to die anymore. She had found reason to live again, and that was the moment her body began to react to the medicine she was given by the nurses.   The van finally got to the hospital, and they took her to a room where the doctor attended to her. However, there were complications that had unfortunately developed because of poisoning herself. She needed a quick and urgent operation in order to save her child, and the doctor hurriedly told her that her ovaries had been affected too, therefore, she was going to take them out. This meant she was no longer going to have kids again and that she might still die if the operation didn’t go as planned. It would be a premature birth, but it had to be done to save lives, and so they took her to the theatre for the operation.   Some hours passed, and the procedure went well. She had astonishingly given birth to twins, one girl and a boy. The doctors were shocked about how this could be because the ultrasound they quickly took while preparing for surgery only showed one heart, and yet mysteriously enough, it was two. It was difficult to see and discern because they were at the same place and seemed like one giant heartbeat, and the shape seemed like it was only one child, but there were two. After some time she finally woke up, drowsy and weak from the whole experience, and she tried to move her neck to the left to see where she was and who was making noise next to her. She saw two beautiful and healthy babies, and she was also in shock!   Ouch! Her stomach! She touched it and felt the stitches. She was alive, and these babies were both hers. She couldn’t believe it. She broke into tears of joy as she tried to move along the bed edge in order to touch them, but the nurses came in and stopped her for she could open up the stitches and create a bigger problem for herself. So they, in turn, brought her babies to her, and she couldn’t stop crying and kissing them all over.   Against all odds, she was a mother and had the privilege of actually seeing them when she thought that death was the only option. For the next few days, she healed and bonded with her babies in hospital. After about two weeks, she began to wonder why the police hadn’t come to question or hold her as a suspect to murder, was it all a dream? But as she was thinking deeply about it, Viola, Melody’s younger sister came in the room. She was shocked that Viola was here, but at the same time happy because she was the only visitor that had come to see her so far when she had expected no one to come. They hugged gently and tenderly to avoid affecting the operation and Viola seemed calm and collected for someone who had just lost a family member.   Viola told her everything about how Melody had planned it all out and that she knew and that’s why she gave a statement and told the truth in order to serve justice, as her profession demands. It wasn’t even in the newspapers like the village girl thought it would be, everything had gone the opposite of how she thought it would.   God is the King of all kings she sang in praise and happiness. She introduced Viola to her two babies, telling them that this was their aunt even though they couldn’t understand what was happening or being said. And so they spent the visiting time together catching up on things from the outside world and on what to do when she was good to go out of the hospital. Viola wanted to help her look for sponsorships so that she could go to school and learn and at the same time find work to fend for her babies.   The village girl agreed, but she only said, “I will do this all in one condition, help me take proper justice against my parents. I want to take them to court so that they pay for their transgressions!” Viola agreed to help, but only if she was sure that this is what she truly wanted. The visiting time was about to end, and Viola opened her bag to give her the fruit that she had bought her and the suicide letter that the village girl had written in her darkest hour. She asked her where she had got it but Viola simply said, “It was this letter that made me tell the truth and stand up for you, we began in a rocky way you and I, but if you promise to love and care for my nephew and niece unconditionally, you are my sister for life from this day onwards.”   When the siren rang for the visitors to go and leave the patients alone, Viola kissed her niece and nephew goodbye and hugged her sister. As she was striding towards the door, Viola paused for a moment and asked her sister what the babies’ names were? And she said, “Blessings.”   Viola was lost and didn’t understand what this meant, and so she asked again saying, “Pardon?”   “Blessings! They shall be called Blessings, because they came from God to give me a second chance at life,” she said.   And Viola walked away smiling and shaking the ground with her high heels as if to notify other people in the hospital that a miracle had just happened.   Finally, she was left alone to bond and care for her babies, her Blessings!
