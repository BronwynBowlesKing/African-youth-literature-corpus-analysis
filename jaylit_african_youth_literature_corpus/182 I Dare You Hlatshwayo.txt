I Dare You     I dare you to stand.  Beaten, broken, bruised  As you are  I dare you to walk.  Walk. Let your legs carry you  To my door and knock.    Let those bloody, bare hands  Slam my door so I can unlock  And open it to find your hollow soul.  I dare you to look at me.  I dare you to dare me to act.  Hurt, ashamed, wronged  As you’ve been  Dare me to react.  Dare me to hold out my hand  And pull you up and let you in.    Dare me to feel your pain  When I look at my door  Where your blood remains.  Dare me to believe you,  And believe in you  As I dare you to believe in yourself.    Dare me to be your strength,  To help you heal  And seek justice for you  As I dare you to let your voice be heard.  Dare me to realise that your pain is mine.    Dare me to remember that we only have each other.  Dare me to know that we are one,  So we can dare us, dare ourselves, dare each other  To stand together.    I dare you to speak.  I dare you to dare me to listen.
