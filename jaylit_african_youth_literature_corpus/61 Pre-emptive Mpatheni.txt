Pre-emptive     South Africa I can’t feel your pulse no more.  The heartbeat of your youth has been swallowed up  By those who choose to replace it with what they think best fits  Don’t they know from your history that you can’t be bent over?  Haven’t they proven that you can’t be fixed?  You have become a man who has skipped his youth.  You have grown up too quickly and now your shoes are more of a burden than a blessing.  The walk to freedom has become a detour to burning farms  The smoke still smell the same as Vlakplaas and you cry out  “Freedom!!!”  You have become a man who aged well before your time  There is no pot of gold for you by the end of your 27 years.  Let me repeat, there is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow  For there is no rainbow to give a hope of sunshine  If we continue to storm upon ourselves  If we continue to not see us as “us”    Madiba left his sunshine, 27 years, and a pot of gold behind for us  They weren’t neatly packed in our skin colour  No, he left it out for us to enjoy its glorious blaze!  He left it behind when he said farewell right in front of our eyes  He left it behind for his human sake so that each of us become a pulse, beating together.
