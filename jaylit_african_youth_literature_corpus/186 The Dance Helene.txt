The Dance  Her eyes smiled  Her smile sang  New emotion jerked her feet to move  And she danced a dance of solitude    Her heart longed  Her dance slowed  Her beauty grew with maturity  But death-like shadow mimicked her ominously    He saw her  She saw him  Heartbeats building began a bolder dance    As each repeatedly stole a mid-step glance  She loved him  He loved her  Through time in sync their steps moved free  The shadow forgotten in their dance of glee    She loved him  He loved her  Through time in sync their steps moved free  The shadow forgotten in their dance of glee    Her stomach swelled  His heart soared  Their steps prepared another to follow  But then below appeared the shadow    His dance ended  Her smile cried  Sorrow caused her an inner feud  And she danced a dance of solitude
