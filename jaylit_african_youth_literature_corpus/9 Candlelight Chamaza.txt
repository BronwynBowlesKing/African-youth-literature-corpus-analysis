Candlelight    By the candlelight at night,  The world was calm and quiet,  A poor heart made a good reader,  As eyes saw a nation leader.  A minute mind in an empty space,  Unlocking the future with a sluggish face,  Pa used to preach oh yes!  Sleep, but life will be a mess  So by the candlelight at night,  She buried that curse.  By the candlelight it was cold,  But she conquered the bed of course,  A little shower on the roof of rain,  The peeping coldness promising days of no pain,  A butterfly flew by  and it was time to sleep again.
