Tainted Diamond       When you stand on the edge of the bridge  And I stumble from its other end  The wind that pushes you to the sea  Appears to be emanating here from me    Yet just like you I fly along with the papers  Landing in city squares before storms.  In your stethoscopes you see me belching  As just like you I die when no one is here watching.  My head was made out of a brain and a heart  So I act along your lines as you pull the cart  The winds and our future blowing this same way    With you and I in our sleep not giving way.  There is a secret I will never reveal even to myself  About how I adapted and molded rejection into the self  As I dwell in a quake that breeds sorrow  There should be nothing from life we can borrow  For it happens in a blink of an eye  Like how you will never know ‘yes’ used to be ‘aye’  Until time blew away its plot  Just as within a blink you will miss a lot.
