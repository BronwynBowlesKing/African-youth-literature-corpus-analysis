What have I done?    Had I a pair of wings; I would flap them   Courageously, and soar straight to heaven  Gallop as the Mighty Thor;  within the sacred hallways of heaven  Demand to speak with God  Without the presence of his bodyguards  Look him in the eyes and ask:  What have I done?  Why is it that I’m being blissfully slapped by  Challenges on a daily basis?  What have I done?  What have you done?  You! My grandest of creations, simply  Refuse to let forth the greatness that  I, the king of kings  The God of kings  Have bestowed  Upon you  What have I done?
