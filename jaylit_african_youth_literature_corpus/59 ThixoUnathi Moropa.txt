  Thixo’Unathi    Heaven has given birth to an angel.  A beautiful flower that was kept safe in the heaven’s womb.  Heaven has given us treasure.  A soul that is bold, smart and strong.  Heaven has given us a being, so kind  Yet so fragile.  A helper that has come to save us from the harshness of the reality  We face.    Her eyes glow when she looks towards the sun.  Her smile is the one thing that fills up our empty souls.  Her words are like  medicine to our broken hearts.  Her personality is that of a goddess.  Her name symbolizes just that.  A rare breed we call her.    She is the first thing we look forward to seeing when  We wake up.  And the last thing we wish to see before resting through the dark bulb-less night.  She wakes up every morning to make our lives  much better.  Something we have never had before.    She collects water for us  when our feet are too tired to walk.  She prepares meals and keeps us fed.  She brushes our hair and ties it in beautiful beaded bows.  Just like her name, a God is with us.  She is pure.  She is light.  She is our Moon.    Heaven has given birth  To an angel.  A gift that we will forever be grateful for
