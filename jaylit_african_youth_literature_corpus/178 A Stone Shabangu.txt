A Stone      They are coming    I hear them    It’s the people.    The cries, the undying wounds, the bloodshed  All of them are coming for your conscience comrade  Your bed knows no peace like empty promises    of a colourful rainbow and a new dawn  sold on a silver platter    Body tossing and turning in the dark  falling over the throne  crawling on the floor for mercy  screaming in agony “Amandla”  because freedom is not yet Uhuru.    Truth, seeking justice, for your own brothers and sisters  whose slogans have shattered the dream of tomorrow    Peace knows no home in your sleep, home is a lie    I hear them, broken-hearted, heavy-spirited with burden    They are coming for you.    I am what you don’t take to mind  I am an ear beyond the masses  an ear that hears no lies go unturned    I have fought alongside them, down the ground  they would pick me up and throw me into  war with anger on their faces and fists up    I have seen people die  like flies every time I left someone’s hand.    I have seen them erase history written on me in caves  I have been thrown in the deepest ocean with messages  to our ancestors, who even today, their bones still lay still and  unfound in the wrath of waters, I am a memory they could never bury  a stone holding onto our ancestor’s soul.
