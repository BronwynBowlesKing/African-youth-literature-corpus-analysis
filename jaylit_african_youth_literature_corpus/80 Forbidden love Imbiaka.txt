Forbidden love    Ours was a forbidden love  She prayed facing Kaaba  While I prayed looking up at the clouds  Occasionally  I would ask my God  Why He is the one to separate us.  I was black, serving spoons and severing hedges  My sweat salting my body and my soul  She was white, furnished with gold chains  Her sweat fragranced with sanitized deodorant  “This is the order of life son,” my mum would tell me  Bitter I was to the society and its obsession with stratification  But every night  Under the disguise of the moon  We would meet under a tulip tree  And for a moment we would  Enjoy our world of no religion, order or color  A world where only love brought us together
