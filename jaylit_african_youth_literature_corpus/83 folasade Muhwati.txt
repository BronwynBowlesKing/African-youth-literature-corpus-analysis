'i have dreams,' you say,  a dream to be a nurse, forget that one Sade!  men, honourable men!  sons of chiefs, farmers and champion wrestlers  have come with gifts seeking   your hand for marriage  and you refuse all in the name of  a white man's education.    folasade!  queen!  remove that crown.  be a true woman like your fellow friends.  wear a wrap, your ipele blouse,  and learn to cook proper vegetable soup!  what will you cook for your husband?    folasade!   as your name,   be honoured  by wearing your  'proper yoruba maiden' crown.   i will rest my case.
