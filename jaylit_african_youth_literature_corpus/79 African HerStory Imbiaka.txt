African HerStory     Have you ever heard of the African HerStory?  The stories of African queens and heroines?  Whose tales have been silenced with the pen of HiStory?  Have you heard of Nefertiti?  Beauty and brains  The Egyptian queen  United her nation with the Nubians  Engineering religious revolution of Monotheism  And sculpting Egypt with lustering monuments and splendor  Haven’t you heard of the songs of the Ndongo and Matamba Kingdoms of Angola?  As they sing to the warrior Queen Anne Nzinga  Songs of how she fought the Portuguese as her brother absconded his throne  A woman possessed with sheer diplomacy and courage  Have you heard of Empress Taytu Betul of Ethiopia?  Who helped her husband defeat the Italians  Or Empress Kandake, who threatened to  Break Alexander the Great’s clean streak of winning wars  And prevented him from going further south of Egypt  Have you?  Have you heard of Charwa of Zimbabwe?  Makatilili wa Mmwenza of Giriama?  Yaa Asanttewaa of the Asante Kingdom?  Women who fought back the brutal hand of Imperials  Have you?  Let Africa rise up again  And remind her children of HerStories  So that the world would see  The valor and beauty in her story
