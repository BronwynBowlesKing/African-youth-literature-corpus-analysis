I am leaving where I come from       I am leaving where I come from  Where I come from the symbol of love is a man hanging on a cross  Stripped naked and battered to the bone  They narrate the story as if he picked the weapons himself  As if he filled the soldier’s arms with strength  As if he never tried to opt out the night before    They say; “that is love, one for all”  Where I come from self love is synonymous with selfish  “How dare you eat when we are hungry?”  Where I come from we are trained to please others  To entertain strangers and leave them at ease   The hefty prize we pay for this is never weighed    Where I come from selflessness is to be empty of the self  Like the sun robs itself of light to give us some  Like the stars endure nyctophobia for our sake  Like our intestines are claustrophobic but stick around anyway    Where I come from love hurts  Love leaves you empty  I am leaving where I come from    It will take more than a quote  To undo this generational tie  To live without trying to die
