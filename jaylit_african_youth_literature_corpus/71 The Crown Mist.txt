The Crown    They tell me to  “fix” my hair  that my hair is too wild  like my spirit,  my being,  my fight,  too wild.    How do you tame the lion in her when a lionness roars out from her head?  When roots grow from her follicles and sprout with kinks and bends  into trees of life and breath  where birds learn flight in nappy nests  and sing their lullabies in the key of spiral.  For her hair so wild and free  Is Africa intertwined in black soil and pride.  For her hair is a crown of curls;  heavy and jeweled  fit for only that of a queen  a mother of the earth  who gives life through the wisdom of her ancient threads of hair  who has known the sweat passion that wet the ground  who has known the rain who kisses the flowers to sleep.    For this queen carries sun on her shoulders,  giving morning to the creatures of night.  She is wind that turns the earth on its axis  She is midnight darkness that grows and caresses the oceans  And she wears her crown of dents and curls and kinks  for in her skin is her secret.  for in her  is life.
