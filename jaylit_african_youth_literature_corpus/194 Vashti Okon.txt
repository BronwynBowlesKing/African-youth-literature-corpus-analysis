Vashti    Synopsis  Queen Vashti of Persia is called to parade herself before a banquet of drunk nobles by King Ahasuerus. She refuses, choosing her own dignity instead and fearing that Ahasuerus will make a fool of himself. The King is influenced by his scheming advisor Memucan to divorce her.    Memucan stresses that Vashti's example will lead more women to rebel. Eunuchs guarding Vashti try to prevent the injustice and are held back by the nobles. The King is distressed after he sobers up but is too proud to admit his mistake. Disorder and discontent follow at the court, and Ahasuerus seeks a new advisor. Vashti has supporters but remains an outcast until her untimely death.    Act I Scene I  The Persian throne room. King AHASUERUS is on his throne surrounded by NOBLES.  Classical music fills the cold room.  NARRATOR 1  For she was fair to look upon,  thus the King thought to show her off,  as did he the other beauties of his kingdom.    NARRATOR 2  Oh, in the third year of his reign,  King Ahasuerus had organised a banquet  for his nobles, ministers, governors and officials.  The exhibition lasted for six months.    NOBLE  Six months indeed! [Laughs and then toasts the audience.]    NARRATOR 2  During this time, he made sure to demonstrate  and brag about the wealth and splendours  of his kingdom, what he’d won and achieved  since the day he was installed as King.  On the grand finale week, he summoned everyone,  I mean everyone – important and unimportant  to Shushan, the kingdom’s capital,  the seat of the palace to feast.    NARRATOR 1  All the Powers of Persia and Media were gathered,  men of timber and calibres.    NARRATOR 2  Shushan, the palace was arrayed in its highest glory,  blue, purple and white were colours of the day.  Wines were the generous river flowing in every man’s cup,  indeed, it was a feast at its flattering height.    NOBLES are toasting golden chalices in the air, chattering and cheering, with ATTENDANTS  on their tails to refill royal wine as desired.    NOBLE  O! Our King, the only power of our kingdom,  the wealth and wits of Persia and Media,  may your reign last forever.    AHASUERUS  [Aside:] Indeed all powers belongs to me, so are you all.  [Palms on his chest, caressing in a showy tomfoolery]  Loveth all that has been shown thee,  even to this hundred and fourscore days?  Yet! I’ll show you more that you in all this time hath not seen,   contained in one,  such that thine eyes would blink a-gaze.    AHASUERUS cont.  [Signalling waiters to refill his cup with wine]  Haaa! Days and days of unending merriment,  upon mine heart hath the savour of wines pleasured with its sweet scents.  [Spreads his arms sideways] Where are my Chamberlains?    HUSSEIN  Here we stand at your service, Your Majesty.    AHASUERUS  Quickly! Hussein and Farzad  and a few of you, my Chamberlains,  enter the haram, you’ve now my permission.  See for yourselves the prettiest property of your King.  Come tell our nobles and wise men of  what all you see there.  Then have the attending ladies bring  Vashti the Universal Queen before me  and on her weighty crown. It is a heavy weight  for her slender neck.  See to it she has support.  Let mine nobles, princes and officials witness for themselves,  that compared to the beauties of my kingdom,  she’s the peak of all beauties.  And let this company see the great jewels I have taken  to hoist upon the Queen of Queens.    FARZAD  We shall see all this done, my King.    Exit HUSSEIN, FARZAD, and CHAMBERLAINS.    Act I Scene II  VASHTI is in her chamber, dressed in a white flowing gown with a blue band around her  waist. LADIES of class, WIVES of nobles, and EUNUCHS are present. VASHTI appears deep in  thought and lonely to one side. Only the EUNUCHS stand close by and guard her.  Enter CHAMBERLAINS.    FARZAD  O! Queen of queens, the one with whom all beauties lies,  the King this day desires thy presence in his chamber.  VASHTI is kept mute for 60 seconds and does not move, while the rest of the players continue  with their business in mime and do not make any noise. Then VASHTI nods to the EUNUCHS  who respond by standing at ease.    VASHTI  [Turns to the CHAMBERLAINS:] Welcome you Farzad, Hussein,  and welcome to all the Chamberlains.  Have you the permission of the King to enter this place?  My eunuchs must see you out if he has not.    HUSSEIN  His express permission, but a few moments ago given.    VASHTI  [Addressing HUSSEIN:] Then Hussein, pure of heart,  be ever a friend to me as you are to every noble here.  [Addressing all the CHAMBERLAINS:] Tell me Chamberlains,  what state is the King?    CHAMBERLAIN 1  He on this day remains King o’er  the entire kingdom, my Queen.    VASHTI  [Kindly:] Nay, prithee, what I ask after is  the state of mind of the King. What is his humour?  I have not seen my husband for many weeks.    HUSSEIN  [Cheerful with respect:] He is very merry and presidential,  as ever a King was.    VASHTI  [Cautiously:] Is his face bright, is it dull with scarlet today?  Has he had enjoyed much of the wine?    FARZAD  He is very bright with scarlet and it becomes his manhood well.    VASHTI  This matter in all the state concerns me gravely.    VASHTI stands to her feet. The CHAMBERLAINS fumble backwards a few steps in uniformity.    VASHTI cont.  [Smiling at the CHAMBERLAINS:] If I were in need of clowns,  don’t you suppose I’d sure have one in my chamber already?  I ask again, what is the King’s humour?    FARZAD  As simple as a goat kid before his nobles, my Queen.  [Pause, then with concern and more quietly, as he looks up at VASHTI:]  In sooth, my lady, all the men have much of the wine.    VASHTI  [Aside, sadly:] This means my husband is likely to  grow quick with rage moment to moment.  [To the CHAMBERLAINS, gravely:] Well then,  be gone with it,  give the King mine reply,  I am tending to my women.    NARRATOR 2  There was a general silence in the Queen’s chamber,  maidens pursed their lips,  matrons looked round with nought to say.  The Queen had dared to say ‘No’.    NARRATOR 1  The Chamberlains, they loitered around  the Queen’s chamber. From time to time,  they’d peep through the silvered cotton to see the Queen.  Peradventure, she’d change her mind.    CYRA  My Queen, may I say a word?  Has it ever been heard that anyone  ever said nay to the King?    VASHTI  Nay! But I know the King more than you all.  All the men are with the King, excited with wine.  Men may do regrettable deeds when such is the case.  I would men be raised up.  I could not see a man down,  nor sooner risk my own pate among them [indicating her head].    The EUNUCHS notice this and draw closer to the Queen protectively.    VASHTI cont.  [To the CHAMBERLAINS:] Say, let me come to him  when he retires to quiet.    CYRA  [Kindly and with concern:] My Queen,  you are more beautiful measured up to all  the women in the kingdom.  The King is well pleased in you.  Not all women find favour before their husbands.  I would thee reconsider,  [pause, thoughtfully:] but for the wine...    IRSIA  [Aside:] First, she’s the beauty of beauties  and also chosen of the King.  She is to be shown before all the powers  of Persia and Media present in great jewels.  But she rejects such honour; what a prideful wench!  I’ve sort such attention all my days but got none.    VASHTI  He is my husband and I, his wife.  I’ve shown him all my charms for as many times  as desired in the closet and shall do so again this night.  But a public display before his nobles,  officials and the simpletons, such I’d decline.  After the feast, he will think better on it and apprehend my concern.    A little time passes and the LADIES tend VASHTI who is in deep thought but tries to be  cheerful. The CHAMBERLAINS look to VASHTI and she shakes her head firmly at them. The  EUNUCHS stand at ease.    NARRATOR 2  For as many times the Queen sighted the  King’s Chamberlains,  she’d give a look that owned their retreats.    VASHTI now grows distressed and the EUNUCHS, seeing this, draw close to her  protectively.    VASHTI  [To the CHAMBERLAINS:] For the hundredth time,  go, give the King mine reply.  Ne’er will I leave my porch,  not even for the grants of half his kingdom,  not even for heaven’s cry.    CYRA  [To VASHTI, indicating affection and great concern for her:]  Are you ready for the consequence, oh mighty beloved?  Your feet are not secure, not so much as last you lay with his majesty.  His mind is now upon all ornaments.  Make pageantry for the court.    VASHTI  [Looking confused and around at the faces of all the WIVES and LADIES:]  This day was bound to come.  I will make no pageantry.  I have chosen the King’s reputation above all,  I have also chosen my dignity.    The EUNUCHS come together and discuss something serious among themselves, while  keeping an eye on VASHTI.    IRSIA  [Aside, haughty:] How can she be so foolish?  This prideful whore of the King should be cast out the palace gates.  Perchance the King will choose my daughter this day for his bed.  She is not so pretty nor so delicate as Vashti.  But she’s well used ’o drunken fools.    CYRA  [Aside with distress:] I know not whether I see this  great woman again in the right safe place she deserves.    Act II Scene I  The throne room, where AHASUERUS and the NOBLES make merry.     NARRATOR 1  Everyone awaited the Queen’s grand entry in eagerness.  Seconds, minutes, hours and moments had passed,  but the great beauty had not appeared.  Where is the beauty of beauties as postulated by his majesty?  Or had he lied to them in their nobility?    Enter CHAMBERLAINS    CHAMBERLAIN 1  [Heads bowed, arms behind] Please, a word for the King!    AHASUERUS  [His smile turns to a deep frown] Why return ye alone?    HUSSEIN  The Queen refuseth to leave her women.  Yet permit me a brief word in your ear, Sire.    NARRATOR 1  There was silence everywhere.  And all hands grew still.  The eyes of thousands,  as present, were on the King,  heads cog to see what he’d do.    AHASUERUS  [Ignoring HUSSEIN, he gnashes his teeth ferociously, his chest moves up and down,  his chin, the target. A loud call:] WI-S-E M-E-N!    NARRATOR 1  They gathered before the King every wise man present.    AHASUERUS  [Sweating on his face] I could consume fire itself this instant.  See to thy knowledge Wiseman Memucan that I don’t.  Provide me this day a lasting counsel on her my wife.    MEMUCAN  O! King, Vashti the Queen wronged thee not alone,  such an act would cause rebellion of women to any throne,  exemplifying for them, a stubborn stronghold,  to despise their husbands and their household  along the length and breadth of your entire territory.  Not a woman shall hear her husband evermore.  Command ye this day my King,  wives shall give their husbands honour,  she must withstand great or small abuse and let him have none.  And let it, O! King,  be published throughout with the symbol of thy ring.  Let Vashti the Queen be no more royal,  but her crown be given to whom would be loyal.    NARRATOR 1  Everyone’s head nodded in uniformity,  in agreement to the wise man’s counsel.  The King was pleased,  and the deal was sealed.    NARRATOR 2  And so was it to be performed?  Would Vashti be uncrowned Queen?  and would she be banished from the palace?  Sorrowful music plays.    ACT II Scene II  As previous.  MEMUCAN  [Aside:] The King is simple to convictions,  less it comes to pass, the moment we’re adjourned,  he be won over by Vashti?  I must see to it that the matter is settled this instant.  [To AHASUERUS:] My King, iron is well smitten while it be hot,  I propose this matter be performed this day.    AHASUERUS  Ye are a wise man,  I’m well pleased with your counsels.    MEMUCAN  My King, see to it that ye go not into the Queen’s chamber.  Let her be brought before the court straight or bent.  Let the matter be patterned and uncluttered this very day.  Remember, a King’s honour is esteemed by his words and actions.    AHASUERUS  Hussein, Farzad, draw near  I wouldn’t that my orders stagger twice  Quickly, storm the haram, seize my wench of a wife and bring her before.  [As they hasten away, AHASUERUS calls after them:]  Shew not thy faces to me except you have her with you.  Be gone with it.    Exit the CHAMBERLAINS.      Act II Scene III  Outside VASHTI’S chamber. EUNUCHS guard the door. Enter HUSSEIN, FARZAD and other  CHAMBERLAINS.    HUSSEIN  O fellows, I prithee, hurry slowly.  We must see to it that no harm is brought upon the Queen.  Or have you forgotten the good old days,  when upon her pleads,  we were let loosed of the King’s bands?  When we went silly and became unfit for the palace rays,  our heads were almost gone, but she intercepted.  She always knew what words to entreat the King  to have us all preserved. Let kindness ne’er be forgotten.  You stay here at the corridor while I go into the haram.    The CHAMBERLAINS struggle with the EUNUCHS to break into the chamber despite   HUSSEIN’S request.    FARZAD  Down with it!  Have you lost all heeds for your Queen?  For as long as she’s confined in the palace,  she remains our Queen.    The CHAMBERLAINS give up but the EUNUCHS are wary of them.   They allow HUSSEIN into the Queen’s chamber. FAZARD stays out to help  restrain the others from breaking in.    VASHTI  Hussein, you are here for the second time, is all well?  And why art thou cast down?  Your countenance hangs like an old rag on a line,  an embodiment of distress, prithee, say something.    HUSSEIN  The King...    VASHTI  Is all well with him?    HUSSEIN  He groweth quick with wrath moment to moment.  There is no temperament in him and the nobles,  they tend to fuel his fire.  He commanded that you be seized by crook or straight.  But as surely as I’m here, no harm shall come upon the Queen.  Prithee, come in your consent.    Exit ALL.      Act II Scene IV  The throne room. Enter VASHTI, CHAMBERLAINS and EUNUCHS.    NARRATOR 1  Women were never to speak whenever the King  was with his officials.  Less she was granted audience by the King  through the demonstration of his sceptre.    NARRATOR 2  And so Vashti kept eye contact with the King.  Perhaps he’d read through her eyes and be reckoned with her.    AHASUERUS  [Staggers a bit] Vashti, alas ye appear before me.  [He turns away from her:]  For as long obedience was found in thee,  you remained my wife this for ten and four years,  but today, you did chose to err,  thus shall you have a taste of your action.  From this day onward, you shall be no more Queen  and cease to live in my palace.  [Pauses and examines the faces of his NOBLES who wait to know his judgement]  Guards, strip her of my crown.    VASHTI falls before the King.    NARRATOR 1  As soon as the word left the King’s mouth,  Battalions of guards surrounded Vashti, grasp her by the arm,  Like a criminal on the run.    AHASUERUS  Take her to the outskirt of my palace,  my kingdom, or wheresoever suits you.  [Thundering:] But be certain ’tis where our paths will  ne’er thread again.    AHASUERUS stands off to one side alone.    NARRATOR 2  They laid hands on the Queen, the guards.  They jerked on her wrist as though she was not,  and her crown tossed carelessly as though ‘twas made of wood.   [Disgusted:] The one whose face they could never bring  their eyes to look on,  now wallows for mercy like a commoner.  Respect does not live here.      CYRA  Be careful with her!    IRSIA  [Aside:] My daughter shall make a better queen.  [Paused thoughtfully:] What if I make a better queen instead?  Either way, the palace shall be mine.    MEMUCAN  Away with her.    VASHTI is dragged away.    HUSSEIN  [Fallen before MEMUCAN:]  Wise man of our time, I prithee,  revisit this matter with the King,  for he yields to your counsels.  Perhaps he’ll hearken and…    MEMUCAN  Fool, off my garment.  What right have you to make such request of me?  Know this, whenever great matters of the  kingdom are discussed, servants like you are never considered.  You are nothing but one of my foot kissers,  and if I want it this day, I’ll be sure the King banishes you  alongside your undeserving Queen.    NARRATOR 1  While Vashti was dragged off the throne,  the King was no more in sight.  He’d moved to the hidden section of the palace  where shades were thicker.    NARRATOR 2  His eyes were reddened, once more contact with Vashti,  and he’d try to undo his command, for even in sorrow,  she appears far irresistible to him.    AHASUERUS  I must act firm.  [To his guards:] Why are you still here?  Would ye that I bring mattress so ye sleep while at it?  Move, I want everything about her off my palace.    IRSIA  It’s finally happening, the day I’ve long wished for,  to see the prettiest of us all tagged the ugliest.  Let’s see what becomes of her beauty without the crown.    NARRATOR 1  Vashti’s eunuchs watched helplessly, powerless against the King,  powerless against his nobles.  The simpletons stood confused,  could someone make clear the matter to them?  Yesterday she was their Queen, today she’s not.  The nobles were gladdened, for now they’d do  same to their wives if ever they revolted against their commands.  But had Vashti wronged the King away in his closet   for such public display of outright rejection?   No one would ever know.    The EUNUCHS cannot keep calm any longer. They rush in to try to rescue VASHTI from the  guards’ maltreatment, but are pushed away by the NOBLES. Pandemonium breaks out in  the palace.    Light fades…      Act III Scene I  The throne room. Some time later.    NARRATOR 2  She was dropped off the palace outskirt,  where she wandered all alone,  for Memucan had ordered all eunuchs to stay back.  The Chamberlains owed their loyalties to him as well,  they could only step out of the palace when relief of duty.  The nobles gave their wives the look that retreated their feet,  none wished to be fated as Vashti.    NARRATOR 1  Several months passed,  and the palace has never remained the same,  everyone lived in confusion.  There was no queen to oversee daily activities  in the palace as before.  Joy was wearied away from the faces of palace inhabitants.    NARRATOR 2  [To NARRATOR 1:] He’s always enraged, the King,  scourging out wrath on anyone whose luck was not for the day.  The Chamberlains now adjusted to  his distress calls the moment he waked,  neither did they give their eyes to sleep at night.  For as long as the King couldn’t stop calling unto  Vashti in his dreams, they thought he was fully awake.    AHASUERUS  [As if awakening from a dream in horror:] It is. It is!   All I have done is marked down.  My law is fixed, written in the breath of… the breath of cheap wine!  [Looking at himself:] Oh, I am base! And fully alone in this anguish.   Who indeed can I speak to of such foolishness?  She can never return to me. Whatever can be set right?  Let me distract myself in attendance to labours of my court.  [Recalling Vashti again, he is pained and gives out a loud screech. Then calling:]   Hus-sein, Far-zad!  [Curses under his breath.]    NARRATOR 1  Here we go yet again, each day this ritual.    AHASUERUS  Don’t just stand there, take my word, give it to my nobles.  Say to them, the King shall appoint his  right-hand man by the morrow. One who’d oversee  to daily politics of the palace in the manner as did… [pause].  What is the matter?  [He roars:] Be gone with it.    Exit HUSSEIN and FARZAD.      Act III Scene II  Outer rooms of the court. NOBLES present.    NARRATOR 1  Could someone tell the King that he needs a her not a him?    NARRATOR 2  Following the King’s issued out message,  Nobles had gathered at Shushan, the palace,  and were ready to take up promotion to the  political office once held by Vashti.    Enter HUSSEIN.    HUSSEIN  Greetings great nobles of our kingdom.  The King shall acquaint your presence soon.  If I may, could I say a word and hope to be heard?    NOBLE  Go on.    HUSSEIN  The King doth greatly esteem your counsels,  prithee, plead with him. Peradventure he’d repent  of his wrath and restore Vashti as Queen.    MEMUCAN  You must be a dog, to love your mistress than your King.  Tell me, with whom does your loyalty lie?  Ought it not with the King be, who’d considered so  minute your status to serve in the palace,  you insignificant fool?  Gentlemen, pay no attention to this mole, can ye not see?  The moment Vashti is restored,  the very reason for our gathering would be in vain.  If she be restored, then we’ve lost all hope of promotion.  [Aside:] Although certainly, I’m sure,  the King would place me above ye’all.  [To HUSSEIN:] I see ye’ll never stop less  your mistress be restored, hmmm.  [To NOBLES:] Gentlemen, I say we shut him up forever,  for as long as he be alive and around the palace,  he might run into luck someday and the King  be convinced of him. Or would ye suppose this  insignificant dog be promoted rather than you?  He’d remove us to have his mistress restored  and it’ll be our heads in exchange. Think gentlemen, think.    NARRATOR 1  And the matter pleased the nobles,  for they knew how badly they’ve behaved towards Vashti.  And so Hussein was surrounded,  beaten to stupor and was prepared to be dragged out.  HUSSEIN is beaten by the NOBLES while MEMUCAN goads them on.    Enter AHASUERUS.    AHASUERUS  Halt! Arrest all commotion this instant!  [Walking closer, seeing HUSSEIN:] What, Hussein!  Whose scheme was this?    MEMUCAN  O King, this matter will certainly be of interest to you.  This man’s loyalty lies with Vashti,  the one in whom ye are displeased,  for she’d committed such an unpardonable  crime against thee and thy kingdom.    AHASUERUS  You don’t say.    MEMUCAN  My King, he is an enemy of your kingdom,  his loyalty lies not with you.    AHASUERUS  Alas, we well know with whom his loyalty lies.  [Directly to MEMUCAN:] Can it be said of thee?  Pick him up, see to it that you pay for his treatment  and all you must make him recompense.    HUSSEIN gets up on his own but can barely stand on his feet.    Enter HAMAN.    AHASUERUS cont.  Welcome Haman,  you’re just right in time for my decision.  Though you appear the least in the order  of positioning in the affairs of my kingdom,  now shall you esteem above all,  for so have I promoted thee this day.    NARRATOR  It couldn’t be, the table was spun  and Memucan was overturned.    MEMUCAN  O King, I wish not to question your decision,  but I stand to remind thee of your promise to me:  “I shall make thee my right-hand man”.  AHASUERUS  Leave now that you still maintain your current position.  I have matters to attend to with Haman.    Exit ALL.        Act IV Scene I  A cave-like building. Enter CYRA, FARZAD and some EUNUCHS bearing jars, cloth  and baskets.    FARZAD and EUNUCHS exchange pleasantries quietly with VASHTI and then step out to keep  surveillance of the environment.    VASHTI  [Sighs] O Cyra, come here [hugging her]  You have no idea of how I’ve longed for your presence.  You, Hussein and few eunuchs  have become my only family.  When days had gone by and your faces I sighted not,  I am disquieted.    CYRA  My Queen.    VASHTI  Will you not cease from addressing me thus?  No crown have I on my head,  nor hold an office worthy of that position.    CYRA  A Queen’s honour is not by the number of her crown.  I’ve always esteemed thee above thy crown while in the palace,  even so now have you command more, my respect.    VASHTI  Neither have I a copper coin to my name.  Poverty is my newfound companion.  I am nothing like the Queen you once knew.  Reckon me as a commoner I now am.  [Pauses] Away with that. Prithee, how are my precious ones?    CYRA is silent. VASHTI senses something is amiss.    VASHTI cont.  Prithee Cyra, what status is the faithful Hussein?  Is it well with him?  He’d ne’er failed to visit but today.    CYRA  He at this point fights for his life,  for so had the King’s nobles made a mockery  of him some days back.    VASHTI  O Cyra! Do not hold back anything, tell me all.    CYRA  Not a thing has remained the same around the palace  since the time of your disregard.  The King would be heard crying in his chamber,  even in his dreams, all he does is cry out your name.  A few days ago, he summoned for all his nobles  to appear before him, to promote one who’d oversee  some matters of politics such that you often performed.  Hussein, faithful as ever, had pleaded the nobles to  consider your restoration as Queen,  but Memucan spate on his request and made  a pig show of him with the help of others.    VASHTI  [Sobs:] Poor Hussein, I brought this upon him.  I feared this would happen, and ’tis but a matter of time  before the eunuchs would be forced to keep off me.    CYRA  Bigthana and Teresh the eunuchs,  two keepers of the door you shall well know,  so much vexed at the injustice, sought audience  and growing more enraged, would lay hand on the King.  They were caught, for they were few in number.  Their fates are yet to be decided.  Many eunuchs would revolt,  if only there were a good number of them.    VASHTI  In all these, I have but just a wish,  let no harm come upon the King.    CYRA  I baffle at the nature of your soul.  So pure your intentions towards the King,  even till now.    VASHTI  Tell me, which noble promoted he?    CYRA  Haman.    VASHTI  Haman, the son of Hammedatha?    CYRA  You speak as though you know so well.    VASHTI  I surely do know him so well.  Hammedatha was once a Chamberlain  during my father’s reign as King.  He was married to one of the palace maids and begat Haman.  Haman and I were brought in the palace.  His father was present during my union with the King.    CYRA  Do you think Haman would act in your favour?    VASHTI  Enough of this desire for my restoration.  Having made up my mind to take my stance,  I am now the captain of my fate,  and I’ll stay faithful to it till the end.  My prayer is that Haman esteems the kingdom  above all things, such as I did.    CYRA  I admire you more each day.  Never seen much of persons who regards  everyone and everything before self, nay,  not as ye are.      Act IV Scene II  The palace. A loud wailing is heard off-stage from the left side.    Enter AHASUERUS from the left.    AHASUERUS  Nonsense, bunch of no-sense making individuals,  get out of my sight!    NARRATOR 1  From the day Vashti was ousted,  no human actions please the King anymore.  Not even the performance of his promoted noble.    Exit AHASUERUS to the right. Enter FARZAD and NOBLES.    FARZAD  Less one of these days, the King be as a wild animal  and prey on us, I will suggest to him that there  be fair young virgins sort for, and let the maiden  that pleases him be made Queen in place of Vashti.  Thus the palace shall observe its peaceful status just as before.    Enter FARZAD and NOBLES.    NARRATOR 2  And the matter appeared to please the King.   He appointed for the assignment officers in all the provinces.  They gathered all the fair young virgins   at Shushan the palace for purification.  Yet long they awaited his attention.  Enter HEGE, followed by IRSIA.    IRSIA  Hege, the amicable one.  I must commend you for your diligent services  rendered the King all these years.    HEGE  Greetings, many hail me  such as you my lady.  I found favour in all ladies’ sights.    IRSIA  In favour, you have found.   In desires, I shall grant thee. But name it.    HEGE  My lady, I stand to be informed,  upon what ground had this entreating found me?    IRSIA  The King has gathered all fair virgins of his kingdom  here and has made thee their custodian.  Is the office not worth the spread of thy fame?    IRSIA moves closer to him, but HEGE, feeling uncomfortable, retreats from her.    IRSIA cont.  It will be in your great interest to know  that my daughter has come of age,  and she is more of a virgin than all the  virgins in the kingdom.  She’s gathered here as well.    HEGE  Prithee, my lady, of what use is this information to me?    IRSIA  See to it that she’s chosen of the King.  Surely you shall have whatsoever reward you desire.    HEGE  My lady, I am only but the King’s Chamberlain.  I have no control o’er whom the King’s heart would beat after.  But this I’m certain about, I shall treat all maidens  equally and process them to the test of the King.    IRSIA  Yet the King’s desires, you possess this knowledge.  Let it be known only to my daughter.  When she’s Queen, your status will be no more a Chamberlain,  yielding to commands all your life,  but you shall rule of the provinces and  give orders to whomever you wish to walk upon.    HEGE  I’d rather be a gatekeeper in the palace  than bring my esteem low to the state you seek to place me.  With your permission, I shall take my leave, lady Irsia.     EXIT HEGE.    IRSIA  Lady Irsia?  That insignificant fool. He dares to call my name.  If I was raised in a royal home like Vashti,  I’d been the chosen one for the King and  you all would call me Queen!    Enter NEDA.    IRSIA  [Addressing NEDA as she walks through to the King:]  I have had words with Hege. He is of no use to us, Neda my daughter.  Go in then and be sure you emerge Queen.  We all know you are no virgin and art known to this manner.  Perhaps your exhibits will bring us the kingdom.    NEDA  As you wish mother.    Exit NEDA.    NARRATOR 1  After twelve months, according to the time of purification,  Six months with oil and myrrh,   and yet another six months with sweet perfumes,  The maidens with their minted virginity were purified   and given beauty treatment upon treatment.    NARRATOR 2  A bath would suffice;  it is but men's minds that think they come in unclean.    NARRATOR 1  Each maiden went into the King accordingly in their turns.  By custom, she went in the evening and returned in the morning,  For thus she’d please the King the whole night.    NARRATOR 2  And if he was most pleased of a maiden, she would not return anymore,  Instead, the rest of the maidens would be dismissed.    Re-enter NEDA.    NARRATOR 1  No sooner had Neda stepped into the King’s  chamber than she returned.  For thus the King was turned off his glory  the moment she walked into his chamber.    IRSIA  [To Hege:] The rule is, a maiden go in the evening and return in the morning.  Then why was my daughter turned down before the show begun?    HEGE  There is no such rule per se.  And no one questions the King’s decisions.  If he said nay, then it is nay.    IRSIA  Nay, I refuse. Take me to the King,  perhaps he’ll take interest and go in with me.  If I’m not conferred as Queen,  I’d sure make a good concubine.    IRSIA tries to break her way to the King’s chamber, but there is a struggle with the GUARDS and she is removed from the palace.    NARRATOR 2  After the King have had a test of all the virgins present,  he finally picked one and placed a crown on her to be his Queen.  The rest remained as concubines and went not unto the King again,  less he desired them.      Act V Scene I  VASHTI on her sickbed, weak and pale.    VASHTI  I stood upon my watch from the window days ago,  and observed candles of joy from the palace.  Such as could only be seen when there was a banquet.  Prithee, do not lie to me in my last hour,  what meaneth this celebration?    HUSSEIN  The King was in search of a new queen.    VASHTI  Has he found her?    HUSSEIN  I’m afraid so, my lady.  Your royal crown is upon her head.  There has been a great feast unto all his nobles and servants,  gifts released to each province for help in search of the finest virgins.  All these took place for twelve month long.  ‘Twas a long time without a queen for the court to look to.  The nobles made strict order, no chamberlain, guard or  eunuch leave the palace until the purification  and selection rite season was o’er.    VASHTI  I see why you all were no more at my side.    HUSSEIN  Not perhaps, I think, for the maidens.  There is much discontent about court.  The air swelters with a dank moss   and anyone’s foot is quickly snatched upon it.  Green filaments are as whatsoever trifle stroking tenderest places   and men madden with gall in their throat for it.  Lights of joy do burn in the open  yet a sconce against the wall is more fitted among the hanging.    Enter CYRA and EUNUCHS with herbs and medicines.    CYRA  How are you dear woman?    VASHTI  It has been twelve months of torture and pain,  and death had refused to bid my cry for an end.  Sometimes I’d lay on my rustic mat and gaze on the dark,  it was the only beauty left after the nightmare of each day.  The moment I closed to sleep, I’d be surrounded by  forces of darkness chasing me to my doom.  When I wake, I’d realise all were true,  for thus my body was still in this world although  my spirit hangs in another realm.    VASHTI  Nay, I’m certain I’d not last till morrow.  This ailment hearkens not to medicines.  I’ve done all I could, if I could see a physician at its earliest stage,  I’d be survived. But ’tis too late now.  Observe the depth of the scales on my skin,  I have no life anymore.  An abandoned property of the King.  Wouldn’t it be of pleasure to have a taste of what made  the King refer to her as the most beautiful?  We shall take turns and dread as many times as wished,  for thus our lucks bids us well –   These, the sons of perdition said when they  forcefully accessed where I dwell.  And so a many hungry men preyed upon me.   I became their point of entry and exit.  Days were no difference from nights.  The little coppers I had, they napped them all.  I had given up the ghost,  but for kind gestures of some few, who lent me their leftovers.  But as soon as they were gone, the sons of perdition would return [Sobs profusely].    The others present begin to lament.    HUSSEIN  I will never forgive myself. I let you down.   Prithee, forgive me my Queen.    VASHTI  Nay, Hussein.  Ye almost lost life in order to save mine.  I owe you an apology, forgive me.  Oh, how I prayed that my case wouldn’t be the end of you.  And now my heart leaps for joy seeing you still standing.  Do not cry so much for me.  Instead, let’s have some joy in good old memories.  Back in the days when I was the King’s favourite,  he had concubines but he chose to be with me often.  I’d take my seat by his side whenever we journeyed on  a ceremonial function to neighbouring kingdoms.  He delegated some matters of politics to me and  considered my words when his wrath tried to take hold of him.  There was so much more…  [Sighs:] But there was a side to him that I begun to see,  when he took hold of the golden cup,  he never stops till he was knocked out.  I was always there to cover him up.  Same habit of his that has caused me this state.  I wished I never agreed to this plan,   the stretching out of the feast which ushered in my fate.    CYRA  Nay my Queen, ye did what a woman ought  to always do, support her husband.  But he took his state out upon his Queen.  No matter what place of mind he was as at that moment,  what worst a crime committed  you that could not be pardoned?    VASHTI  The King has moved on, I too shall move.  I was the author of my fate and I’ve stayed faithful to it.  It is well you came this day.   I do not have another to spare.  [Using the last of her strength:] Let the King live forever,   innocent and with his word ‘graved in stone but   let me be swept unto the margin of history.  If it is else, I will be too remembered and my name used   as a sharp point for staking wives to the ground.  Prithee, love my precious ones but do not tell them of me.  Let them be happy and think not of me, and you,   do not recall me. Speak not of me.   Now I shall wander and deviate from the page of history.  Draw the veil across and do not look, my friends, how I go.     CYRA clings to VASHTI’S hands and keeps her eyes on her even though VASHTI would not be seen at all. HUSSEIN turns away and sobs. VASHTI dies. The company is in great distress. The EUNUCHS lift her body and carry her out.    NARRATOR 1  She indeed moved on, but unto a sorrow-free life.  The yoke and burden of mockery was lifted off.  Only the dead knows what life it endured.    CYRA  [Sobs:] We must prepare her body for the burial rites.  We shall bury her in three days’ time,  at the completion of every rite.  Hussein, prithee, help me prepare a bath for her cleansing.  Although none of her relations are present,  I shall stand in the gap, for I’ve been acquainted of her,   she’d treated me as family.  I shall wash and oil her body to chase away  evil spirits from her urvarā.  Let them say as they would of her,  evil shall not penetrate this one,  for so she’d remained while with us.    HUSSEIN  While you do this my lady,  I shall prepare white roses for her mound.  This we must always bring to her and bring  offering on Hamaspathmaedaya  in honour of the spirit of our dead.  So she shall forever live in our hearts.  NARRATOR 2  Her body was prepared for burial rites,  Cyra washed and oiled her body, for she was same in gender.  She was wrapped with white linen and positioned  in the room to be watched and prayed for three days  where her spirit is believed to reside in the earth.    NARRATOR 1  She was then laid to rest on the third day   on a land adjacent to the palace.  Sands were thrown onto her grave.  The dusk was here and tomorrow would tell a different story.  Vashti was indeed no more.      Act V Scene II  VASHTI’S burial mound. She stands all painted white and in white clothing. She is now a statue erected of herself.    NARRATOR 1  No sculptor has been able to sculpt such a fine woman,  laid untapped in the one whose path unspeakably  lives a trail for emulation.  Bold, fearless and unwearied,  you paid the price for a prize.  The King and his kingdom,   the prize you chose worth your fight  though it cost you all.    NARRATOR 2  The King said you were beautiful,  I guess he was blind.  He couldn’t see beyond the sensual,  that which you possessed,  which fares far beyond one’s eyes.    NARRATOR 1  We see virtue,  we see patience,  we see a woman,  not wavered by the gnashing of fangs,  but firm in her will.  You indeed stayed faithful to fate,  for such you ordained to hold the system still.  You humbly chose to surrender,  that no man’s pride would have it all.    NARRATOR 2  From this day onward,  we know what is expected of us,  and that we shall adhere to,  for thus you’ve enlightened our path.  [To the audience:] We thank you all for granting us  your audience to end silence and hear our  account of a great queen.    Light fades.
