wine stained teeth     wine stained teeth  remind me of  berries in my backyard  we used to pick and play with when we were young  such a mess  everything stained red  every time you left you said  that you would visit again.  But when you stopped I still kept hope  that you’d always return to your second home  not just a friend, more family  but you left me alone with too many secrets to keep    my living room  still reminds me of  pillow fights, blanket forts  you had my toys, I had yours  sleep at my house after every Christmas day  so many nights  everything was a game  every time you won you said  that you would teach me to play it better again.  But when things got serious  I didn’t think you’d mean that  not just a friend, more than I could see  but you left me with too many memories to read    now wine stained teeth  just remind me of  all the bad blood  from when we used to be young
