Door     I closed the door long ago  So that I could glow again  And blow away the rusted emotions    I closed the door long ago to breathe in some fresh vibes  I want to be taken into the arms of the winds  Like the dry leaves  I want to be soothed  By the moonlight  Teasing my face  I tied a knot  Not to remind myself of something  In my to-do list  But to play with my mind  Trying to break the clot    I put a stop sign  On my mind  To rewind blissful moments  I drank some wine  Not to blind myself with short-lived ecstasy  But to relive some alive moments
