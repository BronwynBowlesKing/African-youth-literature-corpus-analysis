Silence    After ages of letting  Your voice slumber in cold sheets  Of solemn gloom put to rest by  The chorus of a thousand hushes.  Awake! I want to fill my lungs with  The air that leaves your mouth  For you did not forget how to speak  Silence is golden and your tongue  Weighs a thousand ounces
