A Spark    In the mist of darkness  I found a spark smiling at me    And it was then, I spoke about galaxies and stars that came at night,  to steal our hearts, our time in the universe.    Once our eyes kissed  There was no turning back, our kiss gave birth to eternity,  opening a world of everlasting joy, no one would dare dream of escaping    Tranquillity reigned and all that life constantly throws in storms ceased,  bowed to a covenant of our lips.    As though we were a kiss incarnate  As though it was meant only for us, it was perfect, we were perfect  We had our flaws  We had our fears  We had our insecurities  We had our misconceptions but our hearts were in love,  and fell deeper in love every time  we looked at each other
