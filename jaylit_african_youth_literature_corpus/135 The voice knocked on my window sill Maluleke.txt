The voice knocked on my window sill     Shhh!!  Silence spoke  I glanced around no one was to be found  Oh, I see  Myself alone, in the midst of the lost souls  They are unseen  But they are on scene  Do what is right  What is easy wont last     I took a step forward  Who are you?  Thats a question in my head  Your heart is pure  Let it control the path that will,  Make your dreams come true     Darkness  Terror  Hope increased  Still I stood  Next to a window sill
