The Funeral     I  “Afini! I call you like I did when you were a boy  When you bathed under the rain naked and happy  When you, my son, wrestled with other kids over playthings  Now you lie there, silent, not talking to me  This is the house you grew in, you and your siblings  These are the faces of your beloveds: Tumini, Boma and Bala  These people playing the Agaba drums are your age grades  But you lie there, silent, unable to dance.”    I watched his father’s hands tremble as he uttered these words  I was a child, but remember the stony faces of kinsmen  A day of sorrow and undulations  The women all rode on dust, broken  “Is this how you leave?”  Then he shows again, I mean the old man.  This time, he held a machete and a broom  He places the machete on the right hand of the dead  Then places the broom on the left  He said: the spirit of the dead knows its killers  It knows the hearts of men and sees beyond our eyes  Take! Take! with this knife, visit those who denied you  The sweetness of breath  With this broom sweep those who snatched from you  the sweetness of light  I have denied no man his goat  nor a cup of water,  Neither dug a pit for a fellow  He who said death is sweet, let him taste it  Let his wife become a widow  let his children become fatherless too  Let them run through streets without pants  And let this air we all share come to him like a fume  And all echoed “amen”    II  I do not know if the dead hear our voices  If truly they direct the paths of their carriers  I wonder at the dramas of huge men  Staggering on their way to gravesides  They say when a corpse refuses to be buried  It is angry, because its killer is standing by    It seeks for vengeance.    When a coffin directs its carriers  It leads them to the houses of its beloved  It seeks to say farewell, to the visited one  Who must come out with a bottle of gin  And beg the corpse to return to dust.  I remember how we ran into houses  For it is taboo for children to behold a coffin.
