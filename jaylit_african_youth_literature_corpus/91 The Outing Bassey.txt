The Outing  The dream goes something like this. I’m seated at a majestic banquet table gasping for air, but doing my best to hide my asphyxiation. The corset I’m wearing is squeezing the dignity out of me, but since I look good, I bear it.  I see French macaroons, broccoli slathered in Velveeta cheese, fruit punch, Hamburg pizza, a pot of white sugar, garlic fries, biscuits, chocolate-covered donuts, evaporated milk, chin-chin, orange soda, petit fours, Lipton tea, red wine, Philly cheesesteaks, and a vat of sour cream on the dining table. These are the foods of my childhood and early twenties. I indulged in these foods for comfort. If I couldn’t fix a problem, at least I could eat it. I still get cravings from time to time. Whenever I bite into sautéed kale with garlic, I catch myself thinking, This is a buttered biscuit, this is a buttered biscuit, this is a buttered biscuit. No surprise that I’m seeing a bounty of biscuits in this dream.  My family and our guests sit at the table. The women wear dresses with muted colors that are quite drab. The men banter back and forth, duking out who is most clever. Their collars are tight around their necks, and I fear they’re choking but don’t know it. Servants walk briskly about the dining hall to bring us food and drink. They look like blurs really, but I know they’re there. My father sits at the head of the table, Mom’s seated beside him, and there are random people I’ve never met, which makes me wonder if I should know them.  My father clinks his glass to propose a toast. He’s donned a super-sized afro that distracts me from his speech because, amidst all these Victorian wigs, how's this afro going to pan out? He looks more suited to attend the Soul Train Awards or bite his thumb at the idea of a monarchy, but who am I to judge? I stuff my face with a petit four, hoping to disappear.  Eating beats talking. I wouldn't even know what to say, or how to say it anyway. A voice is a powerful impression and I'm at a loss for which to use. Should I use the British English my parents speak in polite company or the pidgin they speak in exasperation? Should I use my standard American voice, fit with a slight Bostonian mutter, or the voice I use when I'm about to mollywop somebody's ass? Maybe I should speak the language my parents spoke back home, though I don't know it; everyone assumes English isn't my first language anyway. Maybe then I should use the voice I use with myself. Brief and resolute. I take a spoon of sour cream and eat.  “Lady Arit has a message to report tonight. I’ve heard from guests that it’s a salacious secret. Though I detest scandal, I think it is best her ladyship reveal what’s at hand here.” Everyone looks at me as if I’ll be served for the main course.  “Yes, Arit,” Mom says, taking a drink of wine. “We are most eager to hear this secret of yours. But before you divulge, allow me to share some advice. Nothing hides in the company of a prayer warrior.” The guests break into laughter as I eke out a few words. Mom shifts her eyes from me to the rest of the table.  “Don’t fret over Lady Arit’s peculiar disposition. She’s taking precautions to ensure she’ll relay her message wisely.”  My father clears his throat and waves away the butler ready to serve the entree.  “Hurry now before our good meal goes cold,” he barks.  I look at my reflection in the spoon and see it’s an image of another woman. I refuse to name her, but she shakes her head and laughs through the brass. Better tell them the truth, girl. My face heats up. My corset is too tight, and the humiliation is near. The audience leans in to watch. I knock a pitcher of wine to the ground. The wine coats the floor until it becomes a pool of red. I scoop the wine and realize it’s much thicker than expected and the smell is metallic. Am I dead?  I suddenly remember who I am in my waking life. If the wigs and posturing were out of the picture, I’m not sure there’d be much difference. I hold my knees as I cough as the pool of whatever I’m swimming in rises. I yell but liquid rushes in my mouth and down my throat. I wretch, trying to speak. I can change.  I wake up.  *   I began having this dream after Mom’s phone call. When she confronted me, she wouldn’t say the word. She only asked, “Are you someone engaging in woman-to-woman practices?” The best I could answer was, “I’m not straight.” For a moment, she sounded relieved that the possibility of my dating the opposite sex wasn’t ruled out. But I found myself irritated at her hope to make sense of me.  I pleaded with her that day, to my discomfort. ”Please don't say I’m completely this when I’m not sure I'm fully that.” I couldn't tell if I was five years old or twenty-nine that day. Her voice has the authority of the Almighty, and what do I have? I sounded shrill and whiny talking into the receiver, begging for validation. No bass, all flutter. It was a doomed conversation. There sat a grown woman who had forgotten herself. How sad.  I asked how she found out.  “Facebook. That picture you posted… Are those women or men you’re standing around? I can’t tell. And why are you kissing that girl? Since when did you become...? You don’t look… nice,” she said. “Were you hiding all this time?”  “No,” I said. “I didn’t think dating and hanging with who I want is such a crime.”  Mom clicked her tongue.  “Dear, back where I come from, it is.”  *  She calls the next day in a series of threes. Three times in the morning. Three times in the afternoon. Three times at night. Mom’s obsessed with threes. Her fixation on the number started with her love of all things Jesus Christ. Once she read the passage about how Jesus—the Son—belonged to the Father and the Holy Ghost, she believed everything had to belong to something. Three became her sweet number of belonging. If she bought fruit, she had to buy the navel oranges, the purple grapes, and the bananas because they all belonged in the polka-dotted fruit bowl, together. If she was dressing me for church, she made sure I wore the itchy white lace dress, with the black Mary Jane's and that hideous striped sweater because, according to her, consistency in attire would put me closer to God. I’ve always feared her relationship with God; it seemed to override any need I had when trying to call her attention to what was happening under her nose. I would yank her arm, hoping she would look down, but she was always looking up. For a year, I had kept these worries at bay, but now my anxiety had taken over. Even now, I couldn’t get her to look at me, and I didn’t want to be another hopeless little girl tugging at her mother’s pant leg. The best thing to do was ignore her, especially if she was preoccupied with a higher power. Soon enough, I got a call that let me know exactly where I stand with her and God. We didn’t raise you this way. I begin sending her calls to voicemail.   *  In a moment of weakness, I pick up her call. I’ve watched plenty of bizarre movies where mothers put arsenic in your chicken noodle soup to collect life insurance, or sleep with your boyfriend, or beat you because they’re threatened. This is the woman who picked up a gas station job working the graveyard shift to make a down payment on a house in a nicer neighborhood. She once hid in fear of a gruff man pounding the door saying, “Come outside.” He had a gun. She told me. Thank goodness I locked the door.  She was pregnant with me and, nine months later, I lived in that house.  I take the call. Remove that picture, please. They use social media back home, too. You'll never get to visit back home in peace if they know this about you.  I close my mouth and yell. The following week, I skip her calls through pangs of nausea and gut punches that say, This is my Mommy. I love my Mommy. This is my Mommy. I love my Mommy. The phone rings. I stare. She leaves messages. Deadly messages. I pronounce the following week: The Week of Holy Terror.   Monday  “Isn’t it too much of the same thing? The same part bumping against the same thing?” she asks, knowing I’m not there. “You’re such a pretty girl. Please, don’t let it go to waste.”  Tuesday  She reads from the Bible. “Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw no good.”   Wednesday  She sings.  Akwa convention  Odu ke edem eyon  Nyin ikwo iyun idara  Koro jehovah odong  Nyin Esit  Loose translation: I’m going to hell       Thursday  “I’ve been thinking deeply about your cousin Minnie. I’m sure you’ve seen on Facebook that she likes to practice this woman-to-woman thing…” I take a sip of tea (with a shot of whiskey) and wonder, Where is this going? “Arit, you don’t have to copy what Minnie is doing. Ok?”   I haven't spoken to Minnie in five years.   Friday  She breathes into the receiver before saying anything. I wait. “Maybe you’ve been away too long? You've been sounding different. Come home. Please.”   Saturday  “Should I tell your father?” she asks, though her question doesn't feel like an ask. ”I don't like keeping secrets. Arit, you have put your Mama in a terrible situation. Please fix your morality dear, I’m begging.”  I scream at the phone. YOU KEEP SECRETS ALL THE TIME.   Sunday  Her voice sounds frail.  “I love you.”  *  “It’s pure theater!” Nkechi eagerly listens to Mom’s messages while eating a beef burrito. “She’s an artist—but then again—what Nigerian Mom isn't?” She hands back the phone. After nights of swimming in blood and drowning, I tell her everything. The phone call with Mom. The Facebook photo. The dreadful messages. Everything.  “What picture did she see, anyway?” Nkechi asks.  “The one of us at the parade where I had that rainbow skirt on.”  “Got it.” She nods, giving me a “that sucks” look. “No one should call you out for wearing a rainbow. How sacrilegious.”  “I don’t know what to do.”  “Do you, boo.” Nkechi sits back and swallows the last bite of burrito. “They don’t pay for your flights home, and they don’t buy your hair.”  “I’m gonna keep eating carbs and sugar until I feel better.”  “Not with your fibroids. Don’t become a sadomasochist. Girl, just tell the truth.”  “I’m not sure what truth to tell.”  She flashes me a glance and takes a sip of Coke.  “Yes, you do.”  Nkechi. Life heightens when she’s around. Like that day at the parade, it was already a day full of color and glee, but when she arrived everything got brighter. She had a Grace Jones haircut with those three-dollar biker shorts she got at our favorite thrift store.  Folks danced in the street, and someone wrapped me in a magenta feather boa. Nkechi threw glitter, and for a good hour, I thought I was trapped inside an Instagram photo. Vivid. That’s her. She makes reality an HD experience.   She's a heightener in her family too. Once, she barged in on her family during a prayer (her family prays like they’re in the last days too) and said, “Look, don’t expect any children ‘cause nothing is coming out this canal and don’t expect a husband ‘cause marriage is for fools.” She then pointed her finger directly at her parents, as if she was the adult. “And don’t try talking me out of it. We’re in America, and I’m gonna suck all the power I can from this country before I twirl back to my homeland.”  After much silence, her Mom—Mrs. Odegbami—became equally sassy and yelled, “Your very style of dress says that you are of the flamboyant variety! May you be washed in the blood of Christ as you make a mockery of everything I’ve tried to teach you!” Then she stood up and gave her daughter a kiss on the cheek. “I only pray that life isn’t too hard for you. It's hard enough.”  I wouldn’t have believed this story, that her parents were this accepting, but she still lives at home, parties late into the night, changes her hair every two weeks, and smokes weed in the house (but only in her room with the window open). Twerk on Friday. Energy healing on Saturday. Church on Sunday. Works for me.  I never understood why everyone expected Nigerians to be so dramatic until I met this family and thought I had entered into a Nollywood movie.  Nkechi’s Mom wears a long blonde weave, looking like she’s ready to faint (or wanting to faint) just cause life is that dramatic. The father is usually sitting somewhere in the corner, dosing off. All the while, people scuffle through the apartment from morning to night.  I grew up on the east coast in a forest. Lots of quiet. Lots of brevity. Little color.  I look at Nkechi. “I wish your life would rub off on mine.”  “What does that mean?” she asked.  “I mean, you know who you are. I worry so much that I don’t know if I’m anything other than the worry.”  Nkechi flashed me another look, a bit softer.  “I might tell them what I think but l toe the line. I’ll probably be that weird aunt everyone loves but secretly thinks, wow, her life is ruined. That’s the part I’ve been cast in. I’d never do what you’ve done. Leave my family? No way,” she said. “You’re brave.”   I laughed in utter disbelief. “Brave?” I shrieked.  “All I feel is grief.”  *  Where I come from, fervent prayer is the cure for all human folly. When Aunty Nancy heard about Uncle Emem’s porn addiction, she sent him away (to a motel somewhere), packed up her rambunctious kids, and drove from Hartford, Connecticut to my Mom’s prayer circle. It was held once a month for Nigerian women wanting to pray and link arms. They prayed morning, noon and night that day. I looked forward to this gathering ’cause it brought all of the children together. For one day, it was like Nigeria had descended upon our home. It was the Nigeria I watched on Nollywood, the one where I imagined people wearing perfume and cologne, where the women wore fancy head wraps, and large voices devoured the quietness. I’m not sure what Nigeria is when you’ve been living in the woods in another country for most of your life. But this Nigeria everyone connected with—the gregariousness and large displays of affection—was the one everyone seemed to recognize.  When my aunt visited, I relished the way us children were allowed to play freely. We’d tiptoe through the palo where our mothers linked arms and bowed their heads, rustle for food in the kitchen, and then dash for the yard with a handful of chin-chin, howling into the forest. Our mothers were simmering with a mysterious something that none of us understood. I barely knew the home language—the language they prayed in—so what were they praying for, for hours on end? We took any opportunity to leave the house and shout outside. Our voices echoed through the tall oak trees as we impersonated superheroes, Spiderman, Batman, Cat Woman, Storm, The Incredible Hulk; all of us wanted to save someone and play larger-than-life characters. If my father had seen me, I would have been spanked for not being a good girl, which to him meant remaining quiet and watchful. To have a daughter that dared to scream in a neighborhood where people walked their dogs, rode their bikes, and took note of everything was a travesty. Thankfully, the women praying always seemed to keep my father and his temper at bay. He’d simply grunt, “Someone call me when the room is cleared,” and retreat to his room. After all the prayers, Uncle Emem returned a few weeks later, promising he’d give up porn and talk to the pastor about rededicating his life to Christ. The women were convinced their prayers had made the difference, but I think it was the fact that Aunty Nancy kicked him out, cut him off from his children, and was the breadwinner of the family. He came back to the path of righteousness. That’s what Mom said.  When Mom’s father got diagnosed with brain cancer, she went to Nigeria to pray for him. Her entire family prayed every day at 9 am, 12 noon, and 3 pm for the two straight. Grandpa died a month later, and for some reason, Mom still prays for his recovery. She believes everyone needs prayers, whether they’re dead or living.  Mom prayed for my human folly too. When I was in high school, I took to wearing halter tops because that’s what all the girls wore. From the day she caught me, I wore long-sleeved shirts in ninety-degree weather. “You’re a good girl. You’re good,” Mom said, taking me by the face with tears in her eyes. “You’re good,” she repeated. That night I passed her room and stopped when I heard my name between words from the home language and bits of English. Arit... make her good, Lord. Make her good... My face grew damp with tears. A terrible feeling took hold of me, a feeling that someone had cast a spell behind my back. She gave God a message about who I was without any chance of me stating my piece. I realized that she had something over me, something that could very well kill me if I wasn’t careful—intention. She had a vision of me that always seemed to result in my being bad, or being someone who either needed saving or was at risk of punishment. I had a father who would slap me for any small infraction—not sweeping the steps right, daring to go to a friend’s birthday party, burning the plantain, the list went on. It was like I couldn’t catch a break and all that time I had thought it was my fault. But when I had caught her, my fears about her role in the matter were confirmed. She would most likely pray to God about my heathen tendencies before jumping in to stop a hand from slapping my face. That night I wanted to pray, not because I believed that God would save me, but because I needed someone to hear my side. When she told God “make her good,” I wanted to counter with, “I’m not bad.” I realized that the primary authority figure in my life was not praying for anything that would free me from my pain, because she fundamentally thought that I was a pain. If this was her primary concern over my life—this prayer—spoken thousands of times to the Almighty, then no wonder life was so difficult. I didn’t know if I had the conviction to pray the way my mother did. That night my father and his rage faded into the background, and my mother and her prayers came center stage. I guess she had a direct hotline to phone God in and say, this is who she is, but if anyone had asked me, I’d tell God: “This woman keeps interfering with my nature, and I don’t know what to do.” But that night I didn’t plead my case. I simply cried into my pillow, believing that if Mom thought I was bad, then any cruelty I endured was definitely my fault.   *  I eat an enormous amount of macaroons with no taste. A bright fuchsia cookie ought to splash a berry goodness in your mouth. A tartness in the middle. A crunchy coat to sweeten the deal. I can’t describe what nothing tastes like. It’s more of a feeling. Imagine, your mouth salivating, your tongue clicking against the roof of your mouth, sticky spit and a salty tongue wagging in your mouth, and something fragrant (let’s say a roast) under your nose that’s teasing you, because however good it smells, you can’t taste it. I devour more cookies, eat through the blandness, grab the purple macaroon, then a green one, a tangerine, a yellow, a royal blue. I eat until I hear someone in the distance swear in my direction. It sounds like swearing, the timbre of it, disdainful. I’d rather eat through the blandness, but I hear her.  “How dare you blacken this royal house and your good name with such scandal?!” Mom asks, taking a bite of Charlotte Russe.  I look down at my place setting. A pile of colored French cookies sitting on a plate. The fork is there, and I see the woman staring at me with a smile. “We all have to toe the line.” She reaches her hand through the fork and begins reaching for my plate. “Hand me a macaroon, girl. This gonna be a long night.” I give her a nice yellow one. “Well,” Mom says. “What do you have to say for yourself?” I look down at the woman in the fork eating the macaroon. She looks to be wearing a Victorian dress with her hair now streaked yellow. “Just tell them,” she says. “Tell them you’re different and that you’re gonna stay at the table. Like me.” She chomps away, pleased with herself. “Doesn’t this macaroon taste good?” she says in delight. I nod my head in agreement, not knowing why. Suddenly I get some taste from the bits of cookie in my mouth. Dirt. It tastes like dirt.                                                            *  Here are three things I don’t like about Nkechi. One. She’s stupid. Or maybe she’s psycho, but whatever she is, I find myself looking at her and thinking she’s an absolute heathen. Nkechi's ability to heighten a situation can be a good thing or a bad thing. Usually it feels mostly bad. I’ll never forget that time she walked the streets with lime green spandex, a crop top and four-inch heels. She walked like this through the Tenderloin, the Haight, the Financial District, and the Castro. Past whistling men, past haughty women, past children, past police officers, past the wind, past the rain, past the sun, and past all reason. I offered her a coat, a blazer, a sweater, a scarf, but she refused.  She’d laugh, that cackling laugh. “All I have to do is be Black, pay my taxes, and die.” Does she have any idea who she is on this street? “Stop worrying all the time,” she said. “You got to raise your vibration in these streets and rise above the foolery, girl. Whether you live or die."  Two. She’s a shit starter. Last week we were waiting at the BART, and a shifty-looking man bumped into her. Nkechi snapped. “I’m standing here, idiot!” Now, it’s eleven at night, we passed a man shooting up walking down the steps, and I have no interest in losing my life inside a train station. Nkechi knows this, but she doesn’t care. This man doesn’t scare me one bit. He wouldn’t be the first shifty man I survived. But she—Nkechi—frightened me that day. She always carries pepper spray, a pocket knife, and a punch wherever she goes.  The man’s mouth is fowl, and I'm sure I hate him. He starts talking. Fuck you, you bitch this, you Black this, you c*!% this, you roach this…  I send hand gestures and side-eyes her way, motioning for her to cool it, but she’s ready to pounce.    “You don’t want none of dis at this unholy hour. I will cut you!”   He moved closer. No one’s around, and anyone nearby had headphones in, their faces buried in a book, or a cell phone recording the whole shebang.  “If he touches you, I’ll hurt him!” I screamed. "Walk away. Please."  His attention turned towards me. Fuck you, you bitch this, you Black this, you c*!% this, you roach this. I wanted to throw him on the train rails. Hopefully, only a few of his bones would break. What’s a few broken limbs for someone who has the devil in him? Nkechi laughed in his direction, that cackling laugh. “I will fling you across this platform. No joke, motherfucker. He spat in her direction. Threw his entire head back to do it. The sticky yuck blob landed on her blouse. For a moment, she looked like a hurt kid. I stepped in. Slapped him. Twice. The shock sent him lumbering down towards the other side of the station.  “All the things we got to live with in this country,” she said, rustling for a napkin in her backpack. “I should have kicked him in the balls. He lucky I’m not that fucked up on Jack. If I was, it would be over.” I searched my bag for a napkin to give her. "You were livid," she said. "Did you hear what you were saying? With the way you were yelling, I thought you'd hit me too." There was nothing to lose in that situation. I could hit him, and no one would intervene saying, “Don’t hit that man, because he is so and so.” But what Nkechi did that day… she could have got hurt. I could have slapped her for her recklessness, but I loved her. She a liability though.   Three. She knows I don’t like her. I can love a thing, but not really like that same thing. I love her because she reminds me of home and she knows me from the inside out. She’s gotten the closest, out of all of them, even more than any lover I’ve had. Up until three days ago, I was with someone named Jamal. A brother who always wears a five o’clock shadow. I considered sending a picture of us to Mom, hoping she’d accept this part of me. But then Jamal decided to pop up at my apartment with a Hamburg pizza. He was proud of his attempt at surprise, but didn’t see how destructive his behavior was. Any chance we had ended with that silly gesture. I don’t like people in my space like that. Drop over and not give anybody notice? Who raised him? Truth is, I was waiting for a reason to dump him. Every time he commented on my looks—you’re great looking, you’re beautiful, and I really like you—I wanted to hand him a cardboard cutout of myself and say, “Why don’t you date her.”   I told Nkechi this and she shook her head. “You take being alone to whole ’nother level, girl.” Then she mentioned the girl I dated a few months back. Sarah Jane. A high-brow type from Napa Valley. She was trying to defy her father’s expectations by working at a shelter. We were similar in some ways and could relate to growing up in the woods. Nkechi hated how vanilla she was, but since it got me out on Friday nights, she soon approved. Sarah Jane and I met at some professional event. She kept calling, I finally gave in, and we began dating. Two months later, Sarah Jane wanted to take me for lunch with her best friend, Martha. I ended it a day later. Nkechi asked why, and I said, “Never liked her name.” I’ll never forget how my best friend grabbed my hand to give it a squeeze. “I want you to know that I like you and love you.”  “Ok,” I replied.  “I’m gonna like you and love you until you learn how to like and love yourself.”    She’s kind to me, and I love her, but I’ve never loved or liked a thing at the same time. And I certainly couldn’t like someone who's half heathen.                                                            *  To love a thing but not like a thing is perfectly sane in this kinda world. A world where people love but don’t like, or like but don’t love, or simply hate. I was a quiet girl. A shy girl. Meek. That was me. I didn’t want to hurt nobody. I just wanted to be who I was, whatever that was, but in this trip of a world. I’m lucky. Lucky I’m anything at all. It started with the day someone looked my way and said, you’re pretty. It was a curse. Don’t care what nobody says about the beautiful finishing first. It was. After that, the voices never stopped.  You pretty. Listen well. Pretty girls kiss men. Strong men. Big men. Like that one there. Wait. Not him. He White. He White-o. We don’t want no wahala now. Too much to explain. Find a Black. No African-born Black. Won’t understand you. Don’t make him angry. If he hits you, it’s over. Remember. Divorce is a sin. And you pretty. So pretty. Wait. You not pretty. Blacky. Lips too big. Hair too coiled. Ass too small. And you frown. Why frown? You pretty. So pretty. Wait. Why wear that? Show your legs. They nice. Wait. Why show your body? You a whore? Whore. Wait. You pretty. So pretty. Why wear baggy clothes? Wear a dress. Why you crying? Don’t cry. You sensitive. Stop. Wait. I love you. Fool. Why you silent? Speak. Speak smart. Better than everybody. Not better than me. Sit down. What you say? Shut up. You too loud. No one will listen. You fucked up. For all of us. Wait. I adore you. Don’t you know? Where’s my credit? For loving you? You pretty. So pretty. Be strong. Kiss men. Pray hard. Sit in the corner. Amen.                                                            *  The dream goes something like this. I wake up and see there’s no food or drink on the table. I know other people are there, but I only see my mother, my father, and the woman laughing in the spoon. “Well?” my mother says, “What do you say for yourself?” I look from the spoon to my mother, and then to my father. “I love you, but I don’t like you,” I say. “Never have. And that’s the truth.” Everyone disappears, and a plate of kale with roast potatoes appears on the table. I know the kale was lightly sautéed in coconut oil and the potatoes are seasoned with turmeric because this is a meal I would prepare in my waking life. I’d prefer a chocolate chip cookie, but I realize that this is the meal that will keep me alive. A woman laughs in the distance, and I wonder if it is my voice I am hearing or the voice I’ve always been afraid to listen to.
