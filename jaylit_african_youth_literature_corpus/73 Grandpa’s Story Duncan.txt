Grandpa’s Story    It’s another night  We gather around the fire’s light  There he sits  Clothed in the brilliance of his wrinkled skin  The beautiful sight    “Come closer mmofra,” he instructs  He starts the long tale  The one that never grows stale  The one of the spirits who stole our lands  The spirits who robbed our minds  They came in beautiful vessels which walked on water  Telling stories about a man who will save us  “Were we dying?” Ato asks  “No” Grandpa replies “we were truly living”  They brought solid water  One which showed us our blackness  They said they came to give  But they took and took  They carried my grandmothers away  They pushed my grandfathers into those beautiful vessels  The ones which walked on water  Like their man once did  Within these vessels the hypocrisy hid  Was shown to my grandfathers  Felt by my grandmothers  The night grows darker  The fire dies faster  Grandpa looks at the moon which hides in fear of the story  It is time to sleep
