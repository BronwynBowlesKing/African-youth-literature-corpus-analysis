  Colours     can I ask, what colours are the rooms between your walls?  the brick ones you built up to save you from the storms?  the ones you hide away in when your eyes are open  the ones whose doors you close when it feels like your soul is being broken    (I just want to know)    what colours are the rooms between your walls?  are they brown like the stones people throw?  or white with red streaks like your blood on the snow?    (it's just a question)    what colours are the rooms between your walls?  purple like the bruises from all the ''falls''?  or blue like the ocean you're drowning in?    (I'll ask again)    what colours are the rooms between your walls?  black like the painted windows behind the boards?  or are they grey like the clouds you're so afraid of?    (please tell me what colours the walls are made of)    what colours are the rooms between your walls?  are they orange like the flames that burn you?  or yellow like the little light you're holding on to?    I need to know what colours to paint my walls  I want them to look just as isolating as yours  see, I'm building a fortress around me  but my walls are made of mud and honey
