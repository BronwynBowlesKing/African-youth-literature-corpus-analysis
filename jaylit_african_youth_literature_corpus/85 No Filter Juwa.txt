No Filter    That black skin is stunningly beautiful  And it speaks volumes of the earth’s natural magic.  Those eyes, with gleams of light  That matches the swag of stars at night  Tells of the fashion of grace and delight  You are a real exhibition of black womanhood  For you commandeer poise.  They expect to see your shoulders fall  Like slender stalks of maize,  They expect to see your tears rush down  The slope of your face; the Napolo way      Yet you face the crowd  And take footsteps of gale with you  To tear down contempt and marginalization  For you are one proud, black queen  With no edits and no filters
