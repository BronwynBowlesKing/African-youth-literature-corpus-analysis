Phenomenal      Her soul so fierce, her mind so strong, her heart so brave  You cannot beat her –  Her eyes stare crystal as Venus, her skin as coated with melanin  and bronze. Her hair as dark as charcoal  for it is needed for its lightening powers. Her whole being is a poem.  Words woven to carry souls into humankind’s future.  Her spirit never falls off the balcony on a lonely cold night  Inhale the universe inside her skin  O, what an ennobled delightful goddess of love and beauty  She blossoms.  She is phenomenally a virtuous woman.
