After the End    Lightning flashes, turn this way!  Hurry over here,  My eyes are fixed on the horizon’s edge.  Your absence feels like  A bird no longer wishing to soar in the sky.  All that's left is to glide into deception,  Where the enemy waits to ensnare.  Ah, but joy!  When everyone left me, you remained,  When they said, "A big tree is carved," you held me,   For one must stand for themselves.  "With many hands, the sheep are herded."  Through my pain, I stayed silent, as if untouched by scorn.  When they mocked me, you stood by my side!  When my heart bled like rain soaking the barren earth, you held me steady.  My friend in trials!  Today, joy has returned home and is taking me away!  But who will now carry the heavy burdens I leave behind?
