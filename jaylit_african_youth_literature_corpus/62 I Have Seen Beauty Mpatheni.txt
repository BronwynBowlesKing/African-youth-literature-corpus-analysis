I Have Seen Beauty     I have lived in its house and made myself at home  Its face really broke my heart  I was rejoicing with my tears for their release of freedom  It let me wear its crown  And my head enjoyed its weight, how weightless it felt.  I have seen beauty  It lets me bow down to a Creator  All of Earth grew from within me  And its sun rose straight from my bosom  I bowed down, and the moon kissed my feet  All of us were in energy, in synergy  Beauty kissed my face  And we became one; we won!
