5030    I looked through the hole of time  Into 5030 and there I was  In a museum staring at an ancient skeleton behind the display glass  A mysterious man standing beside me with a long white beard  Stroking it with his callous hands  An act that made him purr like a stroked cat  “They loved the world more than each other,” the man said  They built empires with bones as bricks and blood as water  And printed their magnificent achievements on tresses for the future  Yet they lived for the moment  They fought for land and power  Building more disastrous weapons  While their children starved to death  Replacing rice with landmines  And turning themselves into machines.  They fought over gold and forgot their hearts in the cold  Dug trenches for more minerals and filled these holes with the dead.  Ferried to the planets unknown in the galaxy in pursuit of more  Leaving their own planet with tombstones and obese vultures.  I moved my eyes closer to the display to see this animal  And there it was, the remains of a Human skeleton  Holding a silver sword in its hand  Words “Homo Sapiens with a tool” inscribed below.  I woke up to the news of war and terrorism in the Middle East  Ebola in Africa and drug trafficking in Mexico.  A nuclear test in North Korea and acrimonious sermons on the pulpit  I woke up to a decaying planet and fatuous conferences.
