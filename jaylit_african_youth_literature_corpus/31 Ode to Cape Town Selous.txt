Ode to Cape Town    You are shades of grey;  pure white swirled with night;  obsidian black flecked with snow.  The painter’s brush  is stained gold at its tip  with the shades of poverty  seeping in from above.  You are fresh sea mist  sweeping into the city bowl,  convivial mountains of imposing heights  gazing out to the ocean’s horizon  with bustling streets, thorns of crimson,  and a wilting system at its feet.  Oxymoron filled with braai smoke:  Cape Town, my city  Kaapstad, my home
