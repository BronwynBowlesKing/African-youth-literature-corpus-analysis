Blacks Don’t Cry      God!God!God!  Are you even there?  Every day my life is devoted to you I have conquered all the temptations,  lost people I loved at your silence and absence  yet you remain immune to my dreams.    I do good in this dirty world I see  yet speak nothing about it cause you are there to heal us from all  I see our homes fall apart  I see our leaders’ greed at our expense  I see our skin colour being the tragedy of life  I see how we are not equal  I see how white dogs still eat and live better than us  I see how the poor remain poor from the system that buried our forefathers  I see how the rich keep getting rich    But I pray all will be equal one day,  sometimes I wonder if there’s any truth in your words, come back and  see how people slave their lives to you, their jobs, to the poverty that has become a norm to  live.  What is this life we living?    I have cried all the tears in my soul, broke the spirit where faith was sane.  All my life, I have been loyal to you    but never have you freed me from this hell of a life  I give all my hard-earned money to your messagers,  money that I could have saved to buy my mother a better house, better shoes for myself  instead I give it to my pastor who lives a better life, in a big mansion, drives fancy cars  I am tired I am tired I have nothing. All is given to you  I pray for a better life, not a better job  All jobs are the same, long hours, less money and more debts, I just need a better life God
