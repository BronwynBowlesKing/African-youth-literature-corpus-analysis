Depression is not Cool     I feel alone, surrounded by a crowd,  My world turns to complete darkness,  There is a lot of pressure,  In loneliness, I find the solution to my situation,  I take the risk in my hand,    Tell me that everything will be fine,  that nothing is going wrong,  Even with everything close by,  I feel like I’m lost in a desert,    Loneliness holds me tight,  I no longer have any luck,  I know not if I go South or North,  I have to run from death,    My days are colorless,  My heart full of pain,  My life has no flavor,  and I no longer have love,    The smile leaves my face,  Then I, who is always a fighter,  No longer want to face any fights,  My wounds are not healing,  This is where I want to stop,    I am afraid,  My soul is sad,  It is still soon to die,    I am not to blame for feeling this way,  I do not like being myself,  I need to leave this place,    I just want a hug,  It can change my path,  It can help me take one more step,    I try to be patient,  but I’m still judged for being different,  They do not understand my present,    I find no relief, I can’t let it out,  My will fades away,  and stirs me up all the time,    The melody of a piano,  Makes me think of my plans,  Just one less drop in the ocean,    No one cares,  No one notices,  They don’t change the way they act,  I can no longer bear it,  I can’t go on living,    Sorry mum,  Sorry, dad,  It was not my fault,    I had to make the jump,  My suffering speaks louder,    This is my final breath,  Before I take that shot,    I tried putting an end to my bitterness,  Depression is not cool,  Cold is your hypocritical opinion.
