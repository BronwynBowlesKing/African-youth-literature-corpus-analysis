I Had a Dream    I am sad to know that this will just be one of the many  Sixty-two years ago a great Ghanaian stood and proclaimed our freedom  It brought great joy to the multitude  We had conquered  We had shown our fortitude  If only they knew  Now in the present we are still not free  We are tied to the masters of old  Tied with new chains  Shiny new shackles we mistake for jewelry  Still in the present we fight to look like them  Ashamed of our wonderful skins  We shed them and wear new ones  Fragile new skins in the hopeless attempts at equality  It is clear that we have failed in our bid to evolve  We stay chained  I proclaim today that our stories could have been different  Regardless of what they say we would have been better off  I had a dream that we were untouched by that civilization  I had a dream that we fought them off when they came  That Yaa Asantewaa won that war  I go back to the years before the merriment  The years before the premature jubilation  I had a dream that we never sold our brothers  I had a dream that we were the world’s hub  We stood with our cocoa  They begged for our oil  Paid to touch our soil  My faith dwindles every day  I have that dream less and less  I need a spark  To ignite that fire that burned within  So the dream I had can be the reality we have  So we can say we are finally free
