Mother      You seem as lost as I am  I saw it  Buried in your eyes  I wanted to reach out and take hold of your hand  The one not holding your child  I wanted to tell you I deserve no more than you    I wanted you to see my soul  Not my skin colour  I wanted you to know I am sorry  Sorry that this life has failed you  That it has failed me too    But we are not equal  You know this  I am a meal ticket  Nothing more  And for this I am sorry    We endure this emptiness  And for what  An idea of hope…  The strongest illusion of all
