African goddess    i perch in front of the mirror  peering  with eagle eyes at my reflection    mother says  the mind distorts mirrors  but as my rough fingers trace these  smooth cheeks and my chapped lips  widen into a grin,  the girl in the mirror is a perfect mimic    cautious, but mostly curious  i lift my fingers to the glass    she has earthy brown eyes  in contrast, mine are more of a dull brown  i admire this honey-coloured girl  as i have an unchangeable nut-brown skin  she is long-limbed and must be  lithe as a panther  i am the polar opposite: clumsy as a bear  we share just one feature in common -  our mop of dark hair    i observe the girl in the mirror intently  i can peer at her all day, but  nothing will enable me to really see her  her hopes and her dreams,  her triumphs and trials,  instead i just see her  the girl in my mirror    i notice her perfect poise -  her shoulders back, but i cannot feel  the weight pressed there  i scan her full upturned lips and wonder  the words that have died a hasty death there  to keep from staining this air  i contemplate her pretty throat and wonder  the words which have clawed their way up  to instead be neatly tucked under her tongue  i stare at her eyes  i do not know all she has seen  i do not know the thoughts that have  whispered themselves into her head and  never left    simply, i do not know the girl in the mirror  every day i learn to love  and understand her more  she whose depth and beauty  cannot be contained by  the shallowness  of a mirror.
