Africa is Crying      Africa is crying  From her horn that is Somalia  To her root that is South Africa  To her crown that is Egypt    Africa is weeping  She is in tears looking at what is happening in front of her  Her daughters are being used, abused and killed like flies by her sons  While slavery in her horn is still intact  And her children are killing one another like it is hunting season  Because they are not the right nationality    Africa is angry  She can feel her children’s blood leaking on her land  Turning her soil scarlet red  Africa is hopeful  All she wants is her children to unite and love each other  Africa is praying  Praying that one day all will heal  And finally be one    Africa is us  Africa is home
