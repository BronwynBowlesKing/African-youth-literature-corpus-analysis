Spinster    Her mind throwing a stare at a soul mate  She tosses caution to the wind  Like a die  having missed the desired end.  Yesterday, her heart got stung  But she still awaits true love  Like the Second Coming  And listens to the loud song of time lag    She breathes green light to her admirer.  And when her aficionada reciprocates interest  Her expectation floodgates jolt  Like a dimple on a happy cheek.  That anticipation of “Maybe tomorrow” shall linger  And in the long run  She touches her romantic Canaan  A witness of life becomes!
