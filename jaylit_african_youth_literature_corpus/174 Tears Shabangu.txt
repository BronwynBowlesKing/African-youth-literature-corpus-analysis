Tears      We live physically but spiritually we do not    We are already like the corpses, the difference is that we can speak,  we see, we think, yes we write, but the fact is that the soil weighs us down    Why the cry was not heard, but it was said that a baby who did not cry died in the womb.    Our tears have turned to joy for others,  And the doctor, while my mother took me out of her  Why did they not cry out that I was born to cry?    Yes I agree no crying baby should be born either  but my tears will not mean anything to others,  when will you save my tears?    Yes, I agree in the world you are born alone, you travel alone but where do they go  Personality and compassion?  The fact that we are alive but not alive, we cry sweetly, but then we are silent again, talking.    We are thinking, we are watching...  And when will you end up in tears?    Is Life Tears and Anger?  Where else can we find happiness?  My tears, when will you help me??
