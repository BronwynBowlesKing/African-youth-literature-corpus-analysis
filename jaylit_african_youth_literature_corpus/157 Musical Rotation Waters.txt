Musical Rotation     Paradoxes of my being  Crown the powerful on the exterior  Confine the weak to the interior.    Sometimes I want to believe life is unfair.    But what is it about life that I don’t understand?  I’ve lived it since I touched down from the sky.    Unfair    It wonders, not knowing whether it should smile  Or fume at my ungratefulness to time.    I reply, yes.    It shuts down and never opens its mouth again  As I crawl back to my maker in the ascending smoke  That will pour down again when we condense in s  ummer days.
