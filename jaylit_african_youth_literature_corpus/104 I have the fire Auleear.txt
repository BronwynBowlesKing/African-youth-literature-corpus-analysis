I have the fire     I have the fire  And the desire to acquire  The power to get out of dire situations  For I am capable of creation  Don't let me suffer in pain  For I can gain  That you can't explain    Don't look at me in disdain  For I will push my limits to the extremity of my nature  I will survive dictators  And get more powerful  By the end of the day  Although my stomach may not be full  I will fulfil the desires of my heart    No matter how hurt I am  I shall be grateful for everyone who supports  And not be hateful of the criticisers  critics are ingredients of success  Because of them I rise again    No matter how daunting  Life may become  No matter how many bad surprises come forward  I will rise and view them as rewards    I am on my guard  I have the power to protect  And not the shameful eyes to neglect  Don't question my sanity  For I can leave it aside  Because I take pride for being insane  Give me wings so I can fly  Not a ring  To symbolise your possession  I belong to myself    My self demands loneliness  To escape your barriers  To bury your negativity  I vibe with my soul  I answer the call of my existence  On my own    I wear my crown  Not to reign over a kingdom  But to hold wisdom  I am bold  And cold  Always told to be silent  Because my words are sharp  They prick  Mercilessly  They burn  Savagely
