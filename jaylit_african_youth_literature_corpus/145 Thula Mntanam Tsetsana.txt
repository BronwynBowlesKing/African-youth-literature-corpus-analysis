Thula Mntanam     Introduction  Thula Mntanam [Be Quiet Baby] is an English and isiXhosa tragi-comic play inspired by Pierre Perol’s The Dead Will Awaken. Tsetsana makes use of a Brechtian-style dialectical process in the development of his dramatic material and the production thus partly takes the form of a nested play or ‘play within a play’. In its three Acts, Thula Mntanam sweeps across time from the South African contemporary political context back into the 19th-century history of the AmaXhosa nation, creating an extended socio-political metaphor in which the past and present are interpreted and understood in light of each other.       Cast   Two female performers and two male performers each playing multiple parts.       Characters  Minister 1  Minister 2  Minister 3  Tyson  A – female individual  K – female individual  J – male individual  T – male individual      Act 1 Scene 1    A fatigued Tyson approaches the first Minister.    Minister 1: Comrade Tyson! Ah, it has been what… A year?     Tyson: Ten, Mr Minister.     Minister 1: My goodness! That long? Well, as I’m sure you understand, abusing… I mean running the country is no small task.     Tyson: Absolutely, Mr Minister.     Minister 1: And as the Minister of Nonsensical Nonsense, I need to ensure that, well, that there is no nonsense. How can I help you old friend?     Tyson: Well, comrade Minister, I along with many of our comrades in MK thought that things would get better. That you would provide…     Minister 1: A better life for all.     Tyson: Yes. Sir. So, I was wondering if your department could help me with a…     Minister 1: Jobs… are a tricky business comrade Tyson. Because, if you think about it, the glass is neither half full, nor half empty. But when the chicken comes before the egg, one realizes that, if you push this side, and pull that side, you will find a balance.     Tyson: I’m not sure I understand Sir.     Minister 1: What I am saying is that there are currently no vacancies. But you are a comrade! Something is bound to come about. Try the Minister of Corruption, Coercion and Consumption. You are bound to find something there.     Tyson is adamant, yet he bows, leaves and once again embarks on his long and complicated journey. Fatigued, he approaches Minister 2, who is on the phone. He puts the phone down and embraces Tyson.    Minister 2: Comrade! Commander! Leadership! Chief! How long has it been now? A year?     Tyson: Ten, Mr Minister.     Minister 2: My goodness! That long? Well, as I’m sure you understand, abusing… I mean running the country is no small task.     Tyson: Absolutely, Mr Minister.     Minister 2: And, as the Minister of Corruption, Coercion and Consumption, I need to ensure that, well, our people chow the land, in more ways than one. It is our turn now! How can I help you old friend?     Tyson: Well, comrade Minister, I along with many of our comrades in MK thought that things would get better. That you would provide…     Minister 2: A better life for all.     Tyson: Yes. Sir. So I was wondering if your department could help me with a…     Minister 2: Jobs… are a tricky business comrade Tyson. Because if you think about it, the glass is neither half full, nor half empty. But when the chicken comes before the egg, one realizes that if you push this side, and pull that side, you will find a balance.     Tyson: I’m not sure I understand Sir.     Minister 2: What I am saying is that there are currently no vacancies. But you are a comrade! You are bound to find something.     A disheartened Tyson bows and leaves. Gutted, he embarks on his long and complicated journey and arrives at Minister 3. They embrace.    Minister 3: Comrade Tyson.     Tyson: Minister, I do not want to waste your time. I need a job.     Minister 3: You’re in luck! As the Minister of People, Provision and…     Minister 1 and 2: NO!     Minister 3: (Confused) As the Minister of People, Provision and…     Minister 1 and 2: Cabinet reshuffle! Cabinet reshuffle! Cabinet reshuffle!     Minister 3: (Nervous) Whoa comrades! What I meant was, as the Minister of Pettiness, Pompousness and Protection…     Minister 1 and 2: Protection?!     Minister 3: … of the Party.     Minister 1 and 2: Good.     Minister 3: I now, unfortunately, cannot offer you a job. You see Tyson…     Tyson: Yes, I know. Jobs are a tricky business comrade Tyson. Because if you think about it, the glass is neither half full, nor half empty. But when the chicken comes before the egg, one realizes that if you push this side, and pull that side, you will find a balance.     Minister 3: I’m glad you understand. But you are a comrade! Something is bound to come up.     Tyson bows and embarks on his long and complicated journey. Now deflated and incredibly fatigued, he stops. He watches cars go by. He takes a placard that has his credentials which read: ‘Struggle veteran. MK loyalist. Fought for your freedom.’ After a beat, he drops the placard.        Act 1 Scene 2    T:  Eish guys, I’m sorry, but I didn’t feel it.     K:  You didn’t feel it? You didn’t FEEL it?! You mean like feel it feel it? As in feel…     T:  Yes, damn it, feel it! I didn’t feel it. It wasn’t tangible in the moment. I didn’t get a sensation in my… I didn’t feel it okay!     J:  Leadership, in case you haven’t noticed, we have an audience. So your feelings can voetsek, neh?     T and J get into a squabble, with the other characters trying to stop it. Eventually, A does.     A:  What the hell guys? Let’s get into position and do the bloody play okay. That’s what we’re being paid to do.     K:  Oh, are we now?     A:  Do you have something to add K?     K:  I was just… You know, are we really going to get paid seeing as we haven’t started doing the…     J:  Politics after the production please.     T:  That’s ironic, isn’t it?     J:  What?     T:  We’re doing a political play, and you’re saying we should only bring in the political after the play. But anyway, we got the funding, so let’s do the work. Not that they will care.     J:  Like I said, politics after the production please. Now, stomachs and egos in, creativity out!     J and T clear and prepare the scene for the next Act for K and A. K will have a mop in hand in the next scene.        Act 2 Scene 1: ‘The Play’     A:  Don’t do that man! I could’ve killed you.     K:  With a mop?     A:  You underestimate me wena. Where have you been?     SILENCE    A:  K? Come now, speak to Aunty AA.     K:  I went to see him.     A:  Who’s him?     K:  Something smells nice. Did you get a new perfume?     A:  Perfume mnyefum! WHO DID YOU GO SEE?     K:  Eish A, just leave it girl.     A:  Don’t tell me you went to see...     BEAT    A:  No! What, are you crazy? Do you want a death wish? Dad will kill you!     K:  I know, but...     A:  BUT BUT BUT! But nothing man! He told you to stay away from that boy.     K:  He’s not a boy.     A:  He’s got a pipi doesn’t he? Listen my sister, you need to stop this. You know how dad feels about him. How he feels about them.     K:  Dad, dad, dad! Why does everything have to be about him?     A:  Why does everything have to... I’ll tell you why everything is about utata. He sacrificed everything for us. Made sure we went to school, got an education and have a roof over our heads.     T walks on, but waits and listens before entering the scene.    K:  A roof over our heads? You call this a roof over our heads? He was in the struggle A. Went to prison more times than you can remember. I may have not been born yet, but I know. I know it all. When he was gone for months, you would have to sit in this God-forsaken place, having to worry about the police coming. He abandoned you. And for what? Look at what his beloved politics is doing now. What has it done for the people it freed? What did it do for him? He’s still unemployed. He didn’t get a fancy job and get to steal the people’s money. All we have is African National Corruption. So screw dad and screw the bloody politics of this country!     T:  ENOUGH! You ungrateful little... Is this how I taught you to behave? Is this what I raised? An ungrateful, disrespectful little...     K:  Raised me? Half the time you’re drunk!     T raises his hand to strike K.    A:  Tata no!     T:  Okay. That’s it. I’m done. I’m sorry. I’m not feeling it.     K and A look at each other in nervous astonishment.    K:  (Attempting to improvise unsuccessfully) Uhm... Yes tata. Of course you don’t feel it. You have no feelings to begin with!     T:  K, let it go.     K:  What do you mean ‘let it go’? T.D. Jakes ‘Let it Go’, or ‘let it go’ let it go?     T:  I don’t know. Like I said earlier, I’m just not feeling it.     J:  (Marching onto the stage) Not feeling it?! In case you didn’t hear me earlier, we have an audience. And funding! We have to do a play!     T:  Oh don’t worry, I know, but…     J:  But what? This isn’t a democracy chief. We have to deliver.     T:  Oh? We have to deliver? Have they been delivering?     J:  Heh wena! Politics after the production man!     K:  I won’t lie though. I wasn’t feeling it either.     J:  Oh great. So now it’s about feelings. I’m stuck with divas.     At this point, everyone is on stage.    A:  Actually, I’m also not feeling it.     T:  And it’s tiring being backstage. I’m tired of waiting.     K:  We all are! Waiting for water… Waiting for the load shedding to end. Waiting for jobs.     J:  But we have a job! Right here, and right now, and instead of doing the damn thing, you’re out here complaining.     T:  Yah sure, but after this job, how long will we have to wait until we get the next one?     SILENCE     T:  We’re only remembered if we win an international award or when we die. And then, like Utat’Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela, they promise to name a bridge, university or street after us.     K:  I know right? And now that I think about, people treat utata like he’s God. Sure, he had an important part to play in the fight for democracy. But what about Tambo, Sisulu, Sobukwe, Biko, Hani? And on top of that, EVERYTHING is actually named after him.     J:  Dude, he is Xhosa, like you. You should be proud.     K:  I am proud. But yah man. I’m just saying what most people are afraid to express you know.     A:  She has a point though. Everything is named after him. Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Nelson Mandela Bridge, Mandela Street, Mandela University. I mean, the guy is even on our money now. Utata is everywhere. Next thing you know, they’ll name the days of the week after him. Mandela, Tuesdela, Wednesdela, Thursdela, Fridela, Saterdela, Sundela.     T:  All I’m saying is, don’t love me and cry for me when I’m dead. Appreciate me and my work while I’m still alive.     A:  Hallelujah Amen! We need to make a statement and do something that is memorable then.     K:  Yes! We need something fresh, something that hasn’t been done before.      J:  HIV/AIDS, maybe?     T:  Yah. Because that has NEVER been done before.     K:  I’ll take that as metaphorical ‘yes’. Anyone else up for my idea?     AWKWARD SILENCE     J:  I have an idea and its perfect guys. What if we…     T:  (Interrupting J) Why must we always listen to you? Have you been to the bush?     J:  What did you say to me?     A:  Eish, amaXhosa and their pride!     K:  Come on guys, please. No politics, remember?     T:  Why not? It’s relevant.     J:  I hate to admit it, but he’s right. It is relevant.     A:  This is so awkward. Hell, even a play about the bloody Anglo-Boer War would be better than this.     T:  What did you say?     A:  Nothing! Please, don’t mind me!     T:  No, for real. What did you say about the Anglo-Boer War?    J:  T, we are not going to do a play on the Anglo Boer War.     T:  (Excited) Not about the Anglo-Boer War. What if we did a play about Nongqawuse?     A:  How much?     T:  How much what?     A:  What do you mean?     T:  What do you mean, ‘What do I mean’? You asked me ‘How much?’ and I said ‘How much what?’     A:  What?     T:  Eh voetsek man! You’re making me dizzy. As I was saying, I think we should do a play about Nongqawuse.     K:  What in God’s name is that? Some sort of disease?     T:  It’s the name of a young Xhosa girl.     K:  Her mother was clearly possessed when she named her.     T:  You shouldn’t speak ill of the dead.     K:  What are you on about?     T:  She’s dead. Well, she died… Over 150 years ago.     K:  The mother or the girl?     J:  Voetsek maan wena. The girl!     K:  Okay, so what about this No… (She struggles to pronounce Nongqawuse) What about this girl?     T:  Yah neh. It’s tough in Africa. NO-NGQA-WUSE.     K:  How are we going to tell a story about a girl whose name we can barely pronounce?     T:  Whose name YOU can barely pronounce girlish. Anyway, you guys sort of, kind of know the story, right?     A:  I think so. Wasn’t she a prophetess?      T:  Yebo yes.     K:  So... Let’s hear it.     T:  Hear what?     K:  The story.     T:  We’re actors. We show, we don’t just tell.     A:  But, we don’t know the whole story.     T:  Then we improvise.     J:  You must be joking.     T:  I’m being as serious as a heart attack.     J:  Well I feel like I’m having one right now.     T:  Guys, come on! Accept the proposal. There’s no ‘No’ with us. Let’s do it.     The players are unsure and uneasy, looking at each other with angst-filled gazes.    T:  Okay. So we’ve wasted enough time already. Quick chat, then we do this.     J:  Yoh! (Claps once)     The players get into a huddle and a discussion commences for a few beats. Responses are mimed.     J:  Here goes nothing.     J takes a moment before delivering the first line of the next Act, ‘The Play Within the Play’.        Act 3 Scene 1: ‘The Play Within the Play’    J:  Okay. So, according to Wikipedia, it’s the year 1856. And the setting is the Eastern Cape.     K:  You’re going to have to be more specific.     J is at a loss until...     T:  It is the year 1856, in the Eastern Cape, near the mouth of the Gxarha River.     K:  What is up with all these weird names?     They start to re-enact what they are speaking about with physical theatre and mime.    A:  Herds of thirsty cattle were gathering in the late afternoon at the pools, to quench their thirst.     K:  Everyone knew that they were sick.     J:  With mucous membranes and secreting yellow pus speckled with thick metallic blood.     A:  The Xhosa were losing many heads of cattle. The disease had been brought by…     All: The white man… (Repeated melodiously and absurdly)     T:  Umlungu! The white scum of the sea. The disease was called lung sickness.     A:  On one particular day, a man appeared among the local people. He spoke to them. He was now a man of the cloth. A missionary had converted him to the white man’s religion.     J:  And he felt obligated to save the souls of his tribe. His name was Xolile Mawethu.     They all turn to face J who addresses them.     J:  Hear me, my people, for I bring promise of a better life. Forget your ancestors, for there is only one God, and in Him, and only Him shall you find salvation. God is punishing you! See how He makes your cattle sick. They will all die unless you change your ways!     K:  But no-one was interested.     A:  In the white man’s God.     T:  (Walks over to J who is now looking inconspicuous, scratching his neither region frantically, trying his level best to not look inconspicuous) But Xolile had a terrible secret.     A:  (To J) You did, didn’t you?     J:  What? I don’t know what you’re talking about! (He continues to preach, going from character to character, baptizing and praying for them, scratching when the opportunity presents itself)     K:  For one brief moment in his life… He had succumbed to the temptations of the milky white flesh that he found so alluring.     Everyone gasps and turns to look at J.    J:  No guys, it’s a secret. Meaning that you don’t know what I have done yet!     A, K and T: Oh!!!     A:  It was kind of cool though, you know? The stopping in unison and…     K:  FOR ONE BRIEF MOMENT IN HIS LIFE… He had succumbed to the temptations of the milky white flesh that he found so alluring.     T:  The forbidden fruit!     J:  He was punished for his lust and caught the white man’s disease.     All: SYPHILIS!     The cast uses grotesque physical expressions to express the disease and repeat the word over and over for a short period of time. J slowly but surely starts getting sick.    A:  And even though he believed in the words of the gospel, he sought the help of a traditional healer, who told him how to get rid of his affliction.     The cast form a semi-circle, encircling T, as the sangoma, and J.    T:  Vumani bo!    K and A:  Siyavuma!    J:  I agree.     T:  Vumani bo!     J and K:  Siya vuma!    J:  I don’t understand. I already said that I agree.     T:  Find a young virgin…     K:  He said.     T:  And defile her flesh. Pass on the disease to her, and you will be cured.     K:  And it came to pass that there was a suitable maiden in the village.     A:  Her name was Nongqawuse.     J:  He tempted her... Promising her gifts and fortunes unimaginable...     A:  (While resisting J) But she resisted his advances.     A:  She was only 13 and innocent to the ways of men.     BEAT     A:  One morning when she was walking to fetch water…     J:  He followed her…     A:  … and hid in the bushes, waiting for her to return.     J:  He surprised her!     Physical and metaphorical re-enactment of the rape is played out. A performs a slow and controlled dance, then she becomes frantic, faster and more chaotic, with T leading and A becoming a mere puppet in said ‘dance’.     J:  Surprise!     A:  And made his intentions clear… She pleaded for him to stop.     A’s breathing quickens, her screams muffled by the intensity of the ‘dance’ and J’s control.    J:  But no one heard her screams for help.     A:  And he defiled her.     K:  ‘Mind your own business,’ the onlookers muttered to one another. ‘It doesn’t concern us,’ said another. And as the so-called good people did nothing, Nongqawuse lost a part of herself that she could never again get back.     A:  She ran to the river to cleanse herself of the sin. And the water turned red.     K:  Her innocence was washed away with the tide.     J:  But he wasn’t cured (Staggering and coughing).     K:  And the weeks passed…     A:  And passed…     They circle J.    K:  And passed…     A:  And passed…     T:  But he was not cured. The disease festered…     J is now on his knees and is incredibly weak.    J starts to panic, scratching his entire body wildly. He also hallucinates, reaching out to inanimate objects, only seen by his delirium.     T:  … Spreading through his whole body.     J:  Believe in God!     A:  He said.     J:  He will cleanse you of your sins!     A:  It began to rot his brain.     J:  (Slurring accompanied by involuntary fits) For I am the… Only through me can you… Ahhh!     K:  The people turned their backs on him.     J:  Forgive them dear Lord… for they know not what they… You are the way, the truth… I see a light. I know not what to do.     K:  One day, he ended up in the river.     J:  In the name of The Father.     K:  And he saw Nongqawuse with her friend, Nonkosi.     J:  They are coming to fetch water… (J creeps closer to the girls) And his evil plan was borne upon the wind. He thought of a way to get revenge against his people who had turned their backs on him.     A:  Oh wow Nonkosi, look how clear the water is.     T:  A slight breeze had come, and rustled the leaves of the wild banana trees.     K:  Nongqawuse look... there’s something in the water.     A:  I see it.     J:  (In a deep voice) Nongqawuse!     A:  It is calling me! Can you hear it?     T:  I’m scared....     Everyone freezes     K:  (Aside) Now this is the point where common sense would kick in and tell you to get the hell out of there. A voice is coming from the water. Clearly something isn’t right. Leave! But do you think they did that? Nope! And you wonder why the black guy always dies first in the movie.     They unfreeze     J:  Nongqawuse! I am the voice of your ancestors.     K:  Let’s go Nongqawuse!     T:  Yes, girl! Run!     A:  Wait....     T is in absolute dismay.     T:  Eish!!!     J:  I have a prophecy. This prophecy I need you to tell your people, for you have been chosen.     T:  Let’s leave.... Too late! The cookie has crumbled. He told her to…     J:  Tell the AmaXhosa they must destroy all their crops and kill all their cattle. In return, the spirits will sweep the British into the sea and the dead cattle will rise up from the ashes. They will be healthier and stronger and the crops will be replenished.     T and J:  (To A and K) GO!     K:  Nongqawuse, I don’t think…     T and J:  (To A and K) And tell them…     K:  That this is a good…     T and J:  (To A and K) Of the prophecy! Go!     K:  And so they went back to the village.     A:  (Tentatively) Listen to me… I have been chosen.     K:  But no-one was interested.     A:  The ancestors have spoken to me.     J:  But no one listened.     T:  For she was just a young girl from the village.     A:  I have been chosen to tell you the great news! The dead will awaken!     K:  But they mocked her.     The characters laugh at her, whisper about her, mock and point at her.     K:  Stop it! Listen to her. She tells the truth.     T:  But no-one cared.     A:  You have to believe me! The dead will awaken.         Act 3 Scene 2    T becomes Sir George Grey and K becomes the Scribe, with overacted, accentuated and absurd British accents.    T:  Your Majesty… Hmmm, no. That won’t do. Your Majesty… YOUR Majesty…     K:  So, will that be three ‘Your Majesties’ sire?     T gives K a blank stare.     K:  Right.     T:  I am reporting to you on the native problem. The animals are resilient and…     K:  I beg your pardon Sir.     T:  Oh, what is it now?!     K:  My lord, it’s just… Well… I was thinking… Isn’t the use of the term ‘animal’ a bit... Well, a bit animalistic your lordship?     T:  I pay you to write! Not to think! Now, where was I… Ah, yes. The ANIMALS are proving to be difficult to overthrow, but I have an informant among them that has told me of a strange prophecy and how it came about. I do indeed see a way I can use this to our advantage. Yours in service, Sir George Grey.     K:  Sir, do you not think Her Majesty would perhaps want to know exactly how…?     T gives her a death stare.     K:  Alright! Write, do not think. Got you Sire.     T:  The next day when Nongqawuse and Nonkosi went to fetch water.     J:  The Governor was waiting for them.     T:  (Mispronouncing all of the names terribly) Nongqawuse… Nonkosi… Have you told them of the prophecy?     A:  They are speaking to me again Nonkosi. But this time they sound... I don’t know, a bit different.     K:  Nongqawuse, please. Let’s go. You saw how the village reacted.     T:  You will be punished if you do not tell the truth.     A:  But I am just a girl. They are not listening to me.     T:  Go and speak to your uncle.     A:  Which one?     T:  (Totally caught off-guard) Uhm… That one… The one who explains prophecies.     A:  I think he… them… They mean uTat’Mhlakaza.     T:  Yes! That one. UTat Mahlakeza.         Act 3 Scene 3    A and K sojourn as we transition into the village’s traditional tabernacle.    J:  (As an elderly character with a crooked back, he addresses the audience, but the other players react to him) Eh, molweni madoda, nani bafazi. I have some news. My niece has received a miraculous gift from our ancestors which will save us from the ones that come from the sea. Abelungu!     Murmuring and whispers begin as J introduces Nongqawuse (A) to the gathered ‘crowd’.     A:  Let all cultivation cease. New grain pits must be dug.     K:  Her voice soon became strong as people were finally listening to her. She became confident. Some might say, a bit too confident.     A:  Bigger dwellings must be built.     T:  She had fallen victim… (smirks) … To the charm of power.     K:  And she became intoxicated upon it.     A:  Hear me, my people, for I have been chosen.     K:  One minute she was just a simple girl from a small village, now everyone was listening to her.     A:  Her life now had purpose.     K:  The orders came like daggering arrows.     A:  All the cattle must be slaughtered...     They act out what is being dictated by ‘Nongqawuse’.     T:  For they have been bred by polluted hands!     A:  Strong cattle kraals must be constructed. Hides must be cut into milk pouches.     J:  And soon the British will be pushed back into the sea!     A:  For the day will come, my people, when the dead will awaken, and everything will be restored. Food will be plentiful again. I have spoken and so say the lords. Naphakade!     All: Naphakade!     J:  Eh… Sorry sisi. But when will this all happen?     K looks at A, who nods.    K:  The prophecy will be fulfilled on February the 18th.     T:  (T whispers in A’s ear with A reporting what he says as if she is possessed) For on that day…     A:  For on that day…     T:  The sun will turn red as blood.     A:  The sun will turn red as blood.     T and A:  And the dead shall awaken from their slumber.     T laughs sadistically.    J:  But some of the leaders wanted proof.     K:  How can we be sure you tell the truth?     The congregation nods in agreement. T walks away, a nonbeliever, not believing in the prophecy. He sets himself up so that he can beat a drum or any form of rumbling instrument offstage.    A:  Gather all the leaders and I shall show you.     J:  On a day, when the sun was shining, all the tribal leaders gathered at the mouth of the Gxarha River from which the sea could clearly be seen.     A:  Do your eyes thirst for proof? Then gaze out to the ocean.     The drums begin to rumble.     T:  At first there was a low rumbling of rocks tumbling down to the sea. All were now afraid.     A:  Look! They appear!     T:  And just beyond the waves...they heard the sound of many oxen bellowing over the surf, and they appeared to them. It was a vision of what was to be and a black mass of people came forwards and backwards, with the waves crashing around them. They reached out…     A:  Do you see them? They are the dead that will awaken.     T:  (Now a conformed believer, walks back to join the people) And for the first time, everyone believed.     K:  Every man must kill his cattle…     A:  And acquire its dying breath!     J:  It’s soul!     A:  For it will rise up again on the day of resurrection.     T:  And the chiefs ordered the people to do so.     K:  One hundred (K collapses).    A:  One thousand (A collapses).     J:  Ten thousand (J collapses).     T stands overlooking the ‘corpses’.    K:  One hundred thousand.     A:  Two hundred thousand.     J:  Three hundred thousand cattle were slaughtered.     T:  The ground turned red with their sacrificed blood.     K:  And she spoke again to the people.     J, K and T turn to face A.     A:  There are some amongst us that do not believe that the prophecy will come to pass. I need not mention what needs to be done.     J:  Brother turned against brother.     J attacks K, freezing in the middle of the attack.    K:  Families were torn apart.     A:  And the Xhosa nation was split in two.     T:  The Believers.     A:  Amathemba.     T:  And the nonbelievers.     J:  Amahedeni.     A:  Kill those that do not believe, for the prophecy will not come true if they live!     K:  And the witch hunt began. Neighbours who bore grudges against each other were accused.     A:  And their throats were cut. The earth now absorbed the blood of the people. (Looking back) Those people. Which is exactly what he wanted.     J:  The children were the first to die for there was nothing to eat. Some even resorted to cannibalism.     A:  Have faith my people, for our day will come when hope will be borne from the ashes and we will become mighty once again.     T:  Days passed…     K:  And passed…     J:  And passed…     K:  And passed.     T:  And more people died.     J:  December     T:  The land was littered with the rotting carcasses of cattle.     J:  January.     T:  The stench of corpses filled the land.     A:  Soon my people, we will be reborn when we meet our ancestors and the whites will be swept back into the sea from whence they came.     T:  Everything was desolate... the land wept (he smirks), which is exactly what they wanted.     K:  Everyone was tired and sick.     A:  But the day will arrive!     J:  The Xhosa nation was brought to its knees.     T:  Which is exactly what they wanted!     A:  (Desperate) But the day will arrive!     J:  Seventy thousand people were now dead.     A:  (More desperate and anxious) But the day will arrive! (A repeats this line, travelling from person to person, family to family, and household to household) Feed your hunger with hope. Have pride in your belief!     T:  And finally the day dawned.     A:  February the 18th.     J:  Those who were left locked themselves in their dwellings as Nongqawuse had instructed.     A:  When you open your doors again, you will be greeted by your ancestors.     J:  The people trembled in fear.     T:  But they had faith.     A:  When you open your doors, your beloved cattle will be here, strong and healthy.     T:  They had faith!     K:  She went with Nonkosi and they waited at the chosen place.     A:  Nonkosi, today it will happen. We shall be remembered forever for we have saved the AmaXhosa!     K:  They turned their eyes to the ocean.     A:  And waited for the sunrise.     T:  The dead will awaken.     A:  When the sun rises it will be red, a symbol of the blood that has been spilt.     K:  The sun rose above the horizon…     Hope glimmering     K:  But it was not red… as she had predicted.     T:  The dead will awaken!     A:  Wait Nonkosi. You will see.     T, K and J:  Wait…     J:  The ancestors did not arise from the sea as she had predicted.     A:  Wait Nonkosi…     T, K and J:  Wait… Wait... WAIT!!!     T:  The dead will awaken!     A:  The prophecy will come true.     T:  Where are the dead Nonqawuse?     A:  (Panicked) Look to the ocean!     J:  When will the dead awaken? Hm?     A:  They will appear!     K:  Where are the ancestors?     They start to push A around, becoming violent and inciting mob justice. The violence escalates.    J:  Where are our cattle?     A:  Look to the ocean!     They all look in unison     K:  But there was nothing.     They all look back at Nongqawuse in unison    A:  Look to the ocean! I see them! Look! Beyond the waves!     K:  But the prophecy did not happen.     A:  I see them! The dead have awoken!     J, K and T circle A in a threatening manner, pushing and shoving her     K:  What have you done?     A:  What have I…? No… Greet your ancestors my people!     J:  What have you done Nongqawuse?     A:  Can’t you see the cattle?     T:  But the people turned against her.     They pick her up, attempting to take her off stage. A fights vigorously, screaming.    A:  It’s because some did not believe!     J:  Voetsek! You said the dead will awaken!     A:  I spoke the truth!     T:  They wanted to kill her.     A:  I spoke the truth! The prophecy will come true. It will come true!     Three gunshots fire, startling the ‘mob’.       Act 3 Scene 4    T:  In the name of Her Majesty the Queen of England, I command you to put that girl down or I shall be forced to use lethal and brutal force.     They drop her violently. Nongqawuse weeps.    T:  Nongqawuse, I arrest you on the charge of witchcraft and heresy.     A:  The British she so despised had saved her life.     T:  You shall be sent to the island and serve out your sentence of… Well I don’t know, we’ll see after my cup of tea and a scone then, won’t we dear heart? Up you get.     J, K and T start to mutter and murmur ‘Nongqawuse the liar’, ‘Nongqawuse the false prophetess’ over one another repeatedly.    A:  The Xhosa nation had almost been destroyed.     J:  Nongqawuse! The false prophetess. Your family will be cursed from this day hence.     A:  I was chosen. You people are impatient! Keep quiet and listen! Thulani! Can you not hear them? Our ancestors are speaking to us! They are calling to us. They say that the time for crying and suffering is over! Bathi ‘Thulani bantwana bam! Thulani! Zizojik’izinto!’     K:  Nongqawuse. The liar.     T:  Your Majesty... I am pleased to report that the native problem has been contained, due to the destruction of crops and cattle. The natives were easily overthrown. Nongqawuse is contained and this Dark Continent will always and forever remain an empire of England. I have heard a rather strange and curious report. Nongqawuse has been telling those who will listen to her on the island…     J:  Of a vision… that a great man will one day be contained on the very same island where she is now a prisoner. He will lead his people and offer them hope. He will eventually set them free and it will herald the end of an era.     T:  What absolute bollocks. How can these savages have a saviour when it is us that have saved them? How long will they have to wait before such a man is ever manifested into their god-forsaken DNA?     A:  When Nongqawuse was eventually released, everyone shunned her.     K:  She returned to the very place where it all began, and she died there, still believing that she had been chosen. Nongqawuse vowed to never talk again, waiting for the ancestors to speak to her. It is said that if you go to the Gxarha River, you can still hear her singing softly…     BEAT     All: Thula Mntanam, Thula Mntanam,   Thula Mnntanam Wen’Ukhalelani? (Zizojik’Izinto)   Thula Mntanam, Wen’Ukhalelani?   Thula Mntanam, Wen’Ukhalelani?   Thula Mntanam Wen’Ukhalelani?     Repeat until lights fade to black.
