The uncultivated seed    Restless minds, fertile bodies blend together  in a mesh of flesh, sweat drips from him to  her from her to him.    Creating a wet pool of lust which soon turns to  unspoken regret.  Desire lasting all of 5 minutes leaves embedded  in her a seed.    But things created by foolish people through  thoughtless acts have no chance of survival  they are sure to be ripped of their innocence    Thrown into trash cans left to lie amongst  yesterdays garbage, a beautiful seed, dead,  cold, unloved, unwanted and alone.    Unrecognizable in its plastic filth covered  package.
