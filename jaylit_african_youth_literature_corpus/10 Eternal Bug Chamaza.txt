Eternal Bug    Round and round,  The bug buzzed  Round the lamp.  Someone wanted light,  a little rest at night,  But with that sound?  The bug buzzed round?  With a shabby broom,  Round and round,  They chased each  other round the room.  Oh! he blew out his lamp,  Oh! he broke bad his leg,  Oh! he injured again his neck,  And of course he died instead.  Round and Round,  The bug buzzed  Round his corpse  On the bed.
