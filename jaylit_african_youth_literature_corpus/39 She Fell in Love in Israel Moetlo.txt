She Fell in Love in Israel    At the end of her photography exhibition, Mbali knew exactly where to take her next trip. After weeks of deliberating, surfing through travel packages; comparing them with her budget, she made her final decision, Israel.   Mbali always felt the desire to travel to places rarely visited. Places “red-flagged” due to crime, war and terrorism. “Unpredictable economies,” they called it. Painted ugly; it’s still a painting worth seeing, she believed.   Sunday arrived faster than anticipated. Her flight left OR Tambo International at 22:00 and arrived in Egypt the next morning. She tiptoed to immigration, where she encountered an unfriendly bearded man behind a glass counter asking questions about the purpose of her travelling to Egypt.  She thought about the gentleman back home who served her when she checked her bag in the night before, effortlessly smiling when he said, “Enjoy your trip,” with his coloured accent.   He stamped her passport quicker than she could read his nametag, his eyes staring at the next traveller in line.  The words “Thank you” rolled off her tongue as if he had said, “Welcome to Egypt”. But he was already opening the next passport.   Mbali couldn’t contain her excitement. Even after the seven-hour long flight, backache was a thing of the past. She grabbed her selfie-stick to snap her arrival. It would be a two-hour wait before she could get her next flight to Tel Aviv. Until then, she walked around the seemingly small airport, which is the busiest Egyptian airport, and circulated it in just fifteen minutes. Maybe it was only the area she was restricted to that was small, but busy.   Not new to Muslims within her society, Mbali had still never seen so many different colourful hijabs in one place when she entered the ladies’ bathroom. It was relieving to see someone smile with her eyes under her niqab, it felt welcoming, more so than her earlier encounter at immigration. Standing in the queue, she spotted a black woman, a sister she could relate to.  “Sanibonani.”  “Excuse me?” her American accent came back.  “Oh sorry, I was just saying hello.”  “Hi.”  Mbali hadn’t even left Africa, but in no way did she feel like she was in Africa. No resemblance, or even the slightest hint that Egypt was part of the motherland. She searched for doeks among the turbans that filled the passage. She was now back to the waiting area, facing the sand surrounding the former naval base, which was commanded by the American Forces more than fifty years ago.   Thoughts of what the next fifty years would look like filled her mind between the clock stares, flight updates’ board, and the ever-shifting positions on the cold iron chairs.   “Finally!” she sighed under her earphones when the boarding announcement was made.  Another checkpoint gave her an unexpected culture shock. She had to take off her shoes and was patted down by a female security guard. She didn’t know what shocked the guard the most. Was it her beautifully shaped rear end or the long black thick locks swinging with each turn?  After getting her handbag, cellphone and watch – which she had placed in a basket for scanning – she rushed to the bench to relieve her naked feet from the icy floor, put on her shoes, and then hurried to get onto the first shuttle bus.  Much to her surprise, Cairo International Airport was bigger than she initially thought; the snake drive to the plane took almost five minutes.   “Ladies and gentlemen, please pay careful attention. You will be required to identify your bag. Please do not remove it. Just simply touch the bag that belongs to you, and board the plane, thank you.”  This was the first time she had heard the words thank you spoken by an Egyptian airport official. The bags were all lined up in three rows outside between the shuttle bus and the plane which had the words Egyptian Airline spread across it in blue. Mbali spotted her bag from the window. Everyone before her boarded the plane after pointing it out from the first and second row.   Almost half of the passengers from the bus had boarded when it was her turn to exit, identify her bag, leave it, and get onto the plane. Not that simple for her. Her navy-blue luggage bag was standing in the third row, next to four other bags which had not moved. She confidently identified her bag; when she went closer to grab it without thinking, the security guard watching politely asked her to leave it right there.   “You can board the plane ma’am.”  “I can board?” She hesitated.   “Yes ma’am,” the clean-shaven Egyptian security guard said while showing the pathway to the door with his hand.  He was not like everyone else at Cairo International. Now it felt very strange. So long as it doesn’t turn into Banged-Up Abroad she thought. She turned and gladly stepped onto the 751 Boeing, and a smile from a handsome, green-eyed cabin crew member welcomed her on board. His face lingered in her mind during the flight to Tel Aviv.  When Mbali arrived in Israel, she spotted a man holding a sign with her name on it. She waved and cheerfully said “Hi.”  “Hello Ms, ah, Ms Em-baa-nee, Em-baa-lee, Grute… boo um…? Er, sorry… You will have to teach me how… Welcome to Israel! My name is Mike, short for Michael.” Mike looked perhaps in his late thirties.   “Hi Mike, it’s nice to meet you.”   After travelling for almost twelve hours to join the group of travellers, there was relief in her voice, relief which outweighed her uncomfortable feeling of not having bathed all day. It didn’t matter anymore; she was no longer alone.   Mike led her to immigration, helped her fill out a form, and proceeded to direct her to a group of eleven individuals who were waiting on her arrival.  “…and last to join our group is Mbali Grootboom,” Mike said nodding at me as he sought my approval for what I had just taught him, “from South Africa. Hello and welcome.”  Her small group was made up of four elderly Englishmen, two Irish sisters, two Asian couples, an American blogger, and herself: a twenty-six-year-old South African photographer.  For the first time in her life, Mbali was a minority.  The American blogger who Mbali shared a room with introduced herself as Samantha, twenty-two years old, and self-employed. She had a YouTube channel called “Sammy Tarot” on which she reads cards and mediates with the dead. She called it “spiritual guidance”.   “Oh, you mean like a sangoma?” an inquisitive Mbali said.   “No, I don’t think so. I don’t even know what that is. I follow my intuition and spirits guide me. I burn sage, meditate and get signs from, like, the Universe. You know, like actual signs,” Samantha’s American accent filled the room.  “Ewe sana, it’s like a sangoma. They throw bones and read them.”  “No, but like, my messages are really pure energy and love. It’s more of a feeling, vibrational feeling, yes, that’s what it’s called.”  “Even the sangomas, sana. There’re good and bad ones. Those that are good are also called traditional healers. The bad, it’s considered witchcraft,” Mbali elaborated.  “No, but like, what I do is not witchcraft, I don’t throw bones, I throw charms…” Samantha closed the bathroom door.  “Weird,” Mbali thought, “I’m in Israel and my roommate is a sangoma! Thixo!”  After settling in and getting a much-needed shower, Mbali joined the group for a late lunch in the hotel restaurant.   “It’s a Kosher diet, ladies and gentlemen,” Mike said when he met up with the group.  Mbali walked slowly around the buffet table, worried that Kosher meant something terrible; she saw that all the food there was edible. When she got back to the table, she quickly googled what Kosher meant and found that it had nothing to do with her guava allergy and so she didn’t hesitate to go back for the hummus.  Lunch ended with a round of introductions and Mike confirmed the itinerary for tomorrow.   “Breakfast is served from six o’clock, and everyone to please meet me at reception at eight o’clock.”         ***    The smell of burnt sage filled the air, an echo getting louder and louder, eyes slightly opening to the sound of humming and chanting…  “…spirit we ask for your guidance this morning, what is the message for the day…?”  When Mbali finally woke up, sitting upright in her bed, she saw Samantha kneeling between the twin beds, two candles lit with cards laid across the floor. Samantha’s eyes were closed, waving burning sage over the cards.  Shocked and irritated, Mbali leaned from her bed and said harshly, “I go to a sangoma for ancestral advice; a sangoma doesn’t come to me!”  Mbali grabbed the sage, her brown stockings still tied on her head, stormed to the bathroom, and flushed it down the toilet.   Silence filled the room while both ladies were getting ready for breakfast, their eyes locking between excuse mes and sorrys while getting around their clustered bedroom. Mbali made her way to the dining area. She saw a few of her tour members sitting having breakfast, she waved and went straight to the buffet table.  “Good morning,” Mbali said, taking the last seat at the six-chair table, glad that she didn’t have to share her meal with the sangoma.  Like a disorganized choir, mouth-full, everyone responded, “Morning… Hello… Hi there…”  They all seemed to have had a good rest, considering that every one of them came from different locations and the long hours spent travelling. They were very happy to see Mike come in for a cup of coffee.  “Great to see you all looking ready! I could see the exhaustion in your eyes, the eyes never lie,” he said with a smile, looking at the faces smiling back at him.  After breakfast, they spread out to their rooms to grab a small handbag, catch a pee break and their water before meeting at reception. By eight o’clock, they were on the bus headed to Magdala, a place known for fishing, salt, and boat-building.   They stopped for lunch at a garage, the parking filled with buses, and many tourists from across the world filled the canteen. German, French and even Irish were some of the languages Mbali had to shout over to place her order at the counter.  “Hi, can I please get a chickpea falafel…” she asked while searching for a five-dollar note in her purse.  “One chickpea falafel for habibi,” the Arab man behind the counter said.  “Habibi? What does that mean?” Mbali asked.  “It means my darling. Make it two,” Mike said behind her.  “Oh, hi, I didn’t see you behind me.”  Mike moved and stood beside her while they waited for their lunch.   “Did you get good pictures?”  “Yes, they look great. Even the multi-coloured mosaic floors made it onto the screen. It’s one thing to read the miracles in the Bible, but a whole different experience to see these places.”  “Very true, one can only imagine what it was like over two thousand years ago. I bring many tourists to see the place of the multiplication of the loaves and fish, but it still feels so unreal to me.”  “Shukran,” he said when he took both orders and led her to a table. Mike was an Israeli-born Christian Palestinian. His family home, along with many other Palestinians’ homes, had been destroyed when he was a young boy. They were forced to relocate further away from the city. The heartbreak showing in his shining black eyes while he spoke of the few good memories he had as a child was hard to miss. Not even a photograph could tell how deep the scars were, but his eyes, paging through an old album only he could see, made it hard for him to continue.  On their way back to the hotel in Nazareth and after a late lunch, Mbali took a seat behind the bus driver Jalal. He was also an Israeli-born Christian Palestinian, and almost the same age as her.   The group spoke about their family dynamics, some Jewish-Palestinian marriages and Muslim-Christian celebrations that seemed to overlap, and laughed about the many dietary requests that had to be accommodated on special occasions.   “There, that’s where I grew up,” Mike nodded ahead from behind his MIB shades.  “Over there? Really?” Mbali responded in shock.   There was nothing left, not even rubble, showing that there once was a home across this piece of flat land. The sound of the twenty-seat minibus filled the atmosphere, laughter from the back, a sigh from Mike, and back into town they headed.  “Remember to pack your bags tonight, because there won’t be any time to do so after breakfast. Tomorrow, we leave for Bethlehem, which we’ll call home for the next four nights,” Mike announced as soon as they arrived at the Golden Crown Hotel in Nazareth.  Going through her photos while walking to the room, Mbali didn’t pay attention to anyone around her. It had been a long day, visiting the Primacy of Peter, the Mount of Beatitudes and Capernaum. One of her highlights that day was a boat ride on the sea of Galilea.   She got to her room and found Samantha already packing. They hadn’t said much to each other since the morning’s “spiritual guide invasion”.   “Supper’s from five, nè?”  “Yes, it is.”   Samantha’s response was not as cold as Mbali expected. An ice-breaking intro was all they needed. They giggled on their way to supper where Mbali finally had a conversation with everyone else within the group, sharing stories about their travelling experiences. She started to feel happy about the trip again.  That evening, lying in bed, Mbali couldn’t stop thinking about Mike’s old home. Forced relocations and settlers invading land were thought to be a thing of the past. History repeating itself, taking a different shape, and not driven by race, but by culture and religious beliefs. Similar, yet different, but still oppressive, and the world is surprised why politicians speak of land expropriation. Healing is difficult when the scars are so vivid.  “I promise not to hum too loud tomorrow,” Samantha said in the darkness.  “Okay, sana.”             It was a rushed morning. The two ladies had stayed in bed longer, chatting about their different worlds. Mbali had never been to America but felt that the movies gave some sense of what life would be like in the USA.   Mbali packed everything and left her suitcase outside the room door. She made her way to the dining area where she stuffed her face with croissants; she hated being late.  When she climbed onto the minibus, she noticed Jalal’s green eyes. He smiled.   “Good morning.”  So, she sat behind him.  “Hello and good morning to you all once again. I hope you’re ready for today. We’ll be in Bethlehem for the next four days. Giving you a good rest after the continuous packing and unpacking you’ve been doing,” Mike announced in the minibus.  Mbali readied her settings on her cameraphone for the heart of religion.  The next four days were filled with visits to St Joseph’s workshop, Cana – the location of the change of water into wine – and the Basilica of the Nativity, where YouTube videos show religious men fighting with sticks in the Holy Place.  She visited the Church of All Nations, Mary’s Tomb, and Calvary. With every day she marvelled at the sights of the Western Wall, the Dome of the Rock, and the Holy Sepulchre. In four days, Mbali visited the most sacred and holy places where the authors of the Bible lived centuries ago.  Of all she had seen during her stay in Bethlehem, nothing stood out more than the West Bank wall. Segregating a society based on their religious and cultural difference. And yet not even the Israeli soldier, searching the minibus at the access control point with a rifle in his hand, shocked her.   How cruel are one’s intentions to control and impose laws that in-dignify a human race? She captured it all, through lens and clear eyesight.  In the conversations between her, Mike, Jalal, Samantha and the rest of the tourists who she warmed up to eventually, she felt a general sense of compassion filling the atmosphere. Each culture, country and race has suffered at the hands of people in power. However, everyone seems to have planted rose bushes, despite the external factors, to add happiness in a life full of uncertainties. That’s brave, she thought.  During the last supper with strangers who had become friends, Mbali set up her cameraphone, and she smiled in front of the lens with her companions just in time for the flashlight. From Tel Aviv to Cairo, the group connected by scars, spent one last afternoon together visiting the Pyramids of Giza.           Flying back from Cairo to OR Tambo International, Mbali’s forehead rested against the cold window. She counted the three Pyramids of Giza below, remembering the rough sand between her toes, the ancient stone she touched, and the darkness at the mouth of its entrance. She felt a heaviness inside during the ascent, a heaviness which had little to do with the rough turbulence or the largely intact Pyramids which soon vanished.   The heaviness was the longing to be back home. Though her body was mid-air, maybe over Sudan, her mind was already in OR Tambo International. She imagined herself landing safely and passing the crowded queue for immigration. In her mind, she had already greeted security on the patrol cart in vernac. There would be no forms to complete, no patting, no undressing, and no cold surfaces.   With her head now pressed against the SAA printed headrest, she searched for a comfortable posture. Trying hard not to press her African curves against the passenger on her right, she covered her face from the bright TV screen showing the plane flying over Uganda.   In between the short naps, Mbali pictured her next connecting flight to Cape Town filled with the clicking sounds of her mother tongue, like a marimba playoff, loud enough to command attention but pure enough to sense love with every rhythm.  A shuffle to the left, bum against the cold wall of the plane. She had to check, it had been hours, but the dim light in the plane and snores remind her that she’s still a little too far from home, but flying over Tanzania, a country she hoped to visit soon.  “Excuse me ma’am, we’re about to serve breakfast. Would you like coffee or tea?”  Mbali woke up from an uncomfortable sleep. She caught a glimpse of the plane’s current location. They had just entered South Africa’s boarders at its northern-most province, Limpopo, the land of the fruits. The brightness of the African sun pierced through the clouds, a warm good morning kiss she welcomed with a deep breath.   “Welcome to OR Tambo International Airport, thank you for flying with SAA…”  The pilot’s announcements faded in the back of her mind as she gathered her belongings. Before the plane could come to a stand-still, she and half the other passengers were standing heads tilted to the side and backs slanted. Minutes later, the doors opened, rushed feet dragging bags, everyone eager to get on with their lives after being confined in one space for too long.   Mbali paced past the crowded conveyer belt snail, trying not to think the worst since she last saw her luggage in Tel Aviv. Marching past hundreds of people, feeling like Wonder Woman on a mission, she headed to catch her domestic flight to Cape Town.   Sitting on the iron chair, breathing heavily, and staring at the C6 gate screen for Flight MN133, departing in forty-five minutes, she could barely feel the cold sting through her buttocks. She was glad she had checked-in mid-air.  “I need another cup of coffee,” she whispered to herself.  A cold breeze hit her chubby cheeks when she got out of the bus to board the bright green Kulula flight, the plane was heavily packed in a multilingual atmosphere along with occasional excuses and apologies for occupying the wrong seat. Window seat right at the back was what she had hoped for. There’s nothing more uncomfortable than occupying the middle seat with hips that don’t lie.   The cold aircon at her ankles reminded her of her recent shoeless check-in experiences. Airports are incredibly odd, awkward places; arriving with the entire purpose of getting away as soon as possible.   She saw Robin Island in the distance, was reminded of the history of shackles, and then she looked down at her camera to see a picture of the wall built to confine the Palestinians, the present shackles.   The freedoms in one country to practice any religion, to marry across culture and race, even to travel across borders, were privileges Mbali embraced. South Africa may not be perfect – like the shape of the “Table” Mountain, which is rocky and not like a table you would want to use – where finance ministers are employed for three days, presidents recalled, and questions about a drought in a city bordered by the sea are still unanswered.   Though many would label her country as politically unstable, infested with HIV, and even poverty-stricken, it didn’t matter to her what the world thought. It only mattered what she thought of her home. One’s perceptions of one’s own surroundings and what one does in the moment will either contribute to the suffering or alleviate the struggling.   Here she was, looking down at Table Mountain, a wonder of nature, in a nation where people across the globe flocked to the biggest and busiest airport in Africa – OR Tambo International. It didn’t matter anymore that The Star of Africa from Kimberley was sitting in London along with the souls of Africans who died mining minerals out of the motherland.   She felt sad listening to the lyrics from “Now or Never” by Sankomoto.   …Vuka baba, Vuka, Life has been passing you by, follow your star, it’s now or never  Hayi, you’ve got to make it better Vuka baba, Vuka…  Ironic, she thought, to visit places of poverty, crime, injustice and oppression outside of her country, only to look forward to coming back home where some people are still in the same chains.   She put her earphones in her backpack and waited patiently for the passengers to walk out while she cleared her throat. This was Cape Town, calm and laid-back like the sea, but dangerous just like the sea. The joy she felt when she saw her big blue luggage bag presented to her overcame the back pain she felt when carrying and placing it onto the trolley.  The Uber she called had arrived just in time to meet her at the door. The driver swung the luggage bag into the boot like a Frisbee. The heater was on, and she asked him to put the volume of the radio higher.  “Khayelitsha, right?” the thick French-speaking Nigerian accent asked with a smile.  “Ewe,” she said, resting her back in the far right behind him.  Good Hope FM filled the fast-moving silver Toyota with a welcome home jam she nodded to.  I roll with salute us that’s why the brothers salute us...   Mbali didn’t realize it; she fell in love in Israel while thinking about Africa.
