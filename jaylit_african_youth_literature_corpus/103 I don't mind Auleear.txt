I don't mind     I don't mind looking out for you  in every being who cares    I don't mind believing that you might return  Even if it takes countless moments  or weeks even decades    I don't mind staying alive  Just to hear you again    I don't mind creating my own happiness inside my nest  built upon the remains from our sweet conversations    I don't mind being called a lady drowned in sadness  I don't mind crying sometimes just to keep myself strong    I am fed up convincing myself that I moved on  I thought I forgot you completely when I held someone else's hands  I thought your memories won't torture me again when  I kissed someone else's lips  I tried to bury you inside my heart so you won't emerge again    My foolish self still calls you around two in the morning  When I can't find peace in sleep    My first love is a sweet curse for me  That will never leave my side
