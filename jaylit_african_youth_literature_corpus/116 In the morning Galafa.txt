In the morning    when flowers blossom,  the sun’s tenderness bouncing off waters  molten lava flowing through earth  and fogs meandering over the hills,  the cock crows and night birds run.    the man in the streets whistles,  wrestling in a tag with a stump fragmented  to warm the town when the sun backs off again,  the woman and a baby on her lump stretch their arms  for a life from hearts of kindness  withered from the steam heat birthed at the centre.    the president pauses for a photo with another award,  tongue reaching for his nose like a dying cow.  as, disenfranchised, flies stare at the voter’s pot.
