A beast called Jo    A beast squats large upon the Highveld,  a heaving spiteful monster,  with spines of glass and concrete,  borne from acrid lightning  and the greed of foreign men.  Through eyes lit by shack-fire,  it stares out from the Plateau  and casts out golden lures  laced with drops of greener grass.  But all are lost who take a bite;  the beast is a chimaera.  It gorges on its people’s ambition,  doling out triumphs  in relative quotas,  so that each becomes an addict of More.  Five-million junkies and growing,  all snarling at each other  while holding hands.  Why don’t they just go?  They would if they could,  but they belong to Jo.
