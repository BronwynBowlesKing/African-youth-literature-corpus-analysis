The other side     I wish I could tell you  The story of my life  Not that of strife  But that of confusion  In my quest for conclusions    I wish I could show you  The other side of my life  Full of emotions  Fragile and docile  In the face of love    I wish I could tell you  How much I care  With a soothing melody  A symphony  Written on my face    I wish I could show you  How to write my name  A synonym of euphony  An acronym of care  A middle name so rare
