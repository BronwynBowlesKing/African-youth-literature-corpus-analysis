  Belonging     Sometimes it is too much  The nothingness of it all  An emptiness that stretches out as far as the eye can see  Searching for meaning  For beauty  In the smallest of measurements    For a moment that is nothing more nor nothing less  Simply enough  Perfection in its truest form  She craved it all  Undiluted and unrefined  Meaning amongst the chaos  To understand the light inside her darkness  To feel everything  And nothing    She belonged nowhere and to no one  And yet longed for an anchor  For even she could not tame the seas that called out to her  Pulling her into the deep    She knows now  That one day the tide will come for her  Perhaps to take her home  To a place she longs for  That only her soul  can know
