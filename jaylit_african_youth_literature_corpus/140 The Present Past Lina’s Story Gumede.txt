The Present Past: Lina’s Story  A cold winter day, I wake up to the smell of smoke from the coal stove left burning during the night. “What is for breakfast?” I thought, “Humph, as if I have a choice.”   “Pilisi,” that is what we called her. Our stepmother is one of the most sadistic people I have ever met. I don’t remember why we call her that, but I think it is because every time she would come home from work, for somewhat reason – my stomach would turn. I always think of my mother every time, what she looked like, smelled like, and how she sounded. I was three when she passed away. My father, the leader of the apostolic church, rarely speaks about her. It is as if she is deliberately removed from our memory. But I don’t want to assume.   I get up to get ready for school, but before I could fold my sponge and blankets, I noticed there on the floor of the kitchen door a tin of vaskerese. My stepmother has put it there for me to clean the floors, the stoep, and the window seals with. Mariah, my sister, is already sweeping lebala, and it is my turn today to clean the floors and put the vaskerese on.   “Le tlogeleng lebese laka le nama – ake rutisi basadi,”  objected my stepmother as if one of us had said anything to her. I have often wondered what she meant by those words. I know that she has said that more times than I could count.   “Mosadi?” The fourteen-year-old me I wondered why my stepmother called us that and, although I have always wondered, I have never got an answer.   We shared the crust from yesterday’s pap and black tea for breakfast, and then we left for the long journey to school. The long walk to freedom, I thought. I ought to be very careful with my steps as I begin to watch out for broken glass or stones that may hurt my feet. Barefoot and all, Leslie and I began treading the uphill journey to school. Mariah was the oldest amongst us, and she had already left school before finishing her junior certificate. Pilisi had made her leave school and in two years, I am likely to be next. I have often felt it, a deep sense of longing for something, or someone – I am not sure.   Mariah was working at the factory uptown from our home in Killarney, Soweto. Pilisi found her a job there to work. She often came home every day with the new stories she heard from other factory workers. One day, as both she and I were preparing our sponges to go to sleep in the kitchen, Mariah told Leslie and I a story of a woman who said that her husband had made their daughter pregnant and now she is raising her as a stepchild.   “I know of a one-legged prostitute who took off her wooden leg and hit her male clients with it for refusing to pay up,” interjected Ntate Rorisang.   We burst out laughing. There was something about our conversations which made everything seem alright. For just that moment, life was okay. I always think of such funny stories, especially when I am alone. I always try to picture the people in them, how they felt and if they could laugh at their stories the same way we do.   We arrive at the corner of Kwa-Khethi. She sells magwinya for twenty cents – the best in Soweto I think. Leslie walks in the shop and buys two magwinyas. Ntate had given him thirty-five cents as carry money. I watched him combine two magwinyas with some cold meat and gobble them down. My mouth began to salivate as my eyes turned to bitter hate. I had a crust for breakfast and Ntate gives Leslie money to buy magwinya. I could not understand why he spoilt him. At no particular moment did Leslie think to share with me and it was these unfair privileges he had which made me loathe and envy him at the same time.   “Are tsamaye,” said Leslie, after wiping his oily mouth using the back of his hand.  Today is going to be a good day, I thought to myself. As we began to walk, I thought of her again, my mother. The only thing that my father told me about her was that I was named after her. The English name belonged to her, whilst my Sotho name was my distant aunt’s. I think I would have been closer to her than any of my siblings because of our name. Our name was the only connection I was left with, and I knew that I would treasure that forever. After descending down the hill, there down the dusty streets was our school.   “Bakwala gate!” exclaimed Leslie as he started run as fast as he could, leaving me behind. Of course he could, after all the precious son had the shoes to protect him against the harsh stones and cold underneath our feet. I don’t mean to despise him, but he’s just too spoilt. He is more likely to finish high school, as my stepmother does not let us forget.  I also began to run because I don’t want Meneer Khumalo to reprimand me and accuse me of strolling after hearing the school bell.   “Lina!” shouted Meneer. “You two are always late. Are you not tired of the lashes from the principal?”   “We are sir,” I responded. “It is the house chores we need to finish before heading to school every day. We will try to be early from tomorrow, sir.”   “Alright, you are lucky because the principal is not in today – run to the assembly quickly.”   The long lines, both hands on the shoulders of the pupil in front guaranteed that our lines were straight and that there was no commotion. Zindzi, the best choir leader at our school, started our morning song with a beaming smile on her face. Her confidence and beauty could not stop me from always staring at her whenever she sang. She was sure to capture the attention of the teachers and all the learners. She wasn’t scared. She sang. There was something about this song today, although I had heard it for the hundredth time. I felt the warm flowing of my tear on my right cheek. The song resonated and stirred up a deep feeling of discomfort and longing. I quickly wiped my cheek in case someone sees me. I never understand why I always get emotional every time on the fifteenth of every month. Mariah says that it is PMS or something.   “Every time a lady goes to the ‘market’ her body and her emotions are sensitive” – I remembered that from our bedtime conversations. Mistress Magwaza leads the Lord’s prayer every morning. The words are said in SeSotho and, immediately after that, line-by-line we begin to go to class.   I really like school, but knowing that I may not even finish high school is a painful part of my story. I will probably work in the same factory as Mariah and every morning after our chores – we will both tread along to catch the 7:30 train at Phefeni. I hardly even dream about what I will be one day. I know that Ntate will not even object to us working after before junior certificate. It is expected that I will get married soon, then in doing so – no money would be wasted on taking me to school.          ***  The afternoon rain came unexpectedly. Leslie and I wait until it stops because we couldn’t start walking home through the rain. The ticking clock in the classroom was as loud as the dripping sound of water through the ceiling. Our tin roof class was no match against the howling wind which sounded like an angry confrontation between the wind and the trees. I start to peer through the window to see if the rain was stopping.   “Ke ya Medupi,” said Leslie, referring to the soft rain showers. “Pula ya Medupi.”  I remembered when Ntate used that term when describing such a rainfall. He always said that this kind of rain is often associated with the kind people anticipate before harvest season. This rain was sure not to kill any vegetation, but water could seep through the soil instead of washing it away, causing a flood. These conversations with Ntate are the ones which remind me how intelligent he was. He always spoke in English whenever he schooled Leslie, Mariah and I. His accent all of a sudden changed, each syllable was carefully pronounced as he articulated every fact to us. “It’s stopping!” exclaimed Leslie.   Frightened by the screeching of the table as he stood up, we start to pick up our school bags and head for the door. We then begin to walk towards the gate, and we say goodbye to Ntate Mojalefa, the caretaker. We were the last to leave the school and we started to walk.  The dark night is approaching, and Leslie and I start to walk faster. As we come near the street, we see a dark cloud of smoke from our chimney. Pilisi is home; I turn to Leslie. He stares at me and doesn’t say a word. We enter, and as we do, the scary silence shouted at us as we open the door. The cold stare from our stepmother was sharp and piercing. She silently closed the pap pot on the stove and moved towards us.   Leslie murmured that the rain had closed us in and we were waiting for it to stop before walking back home. She glanced and me, and back at Leslie, and walked away. I was shocked. Her silence felt worse than her beatings. I knew that it was not over. Somehow I prefer to get beaten because that meant that the punishment was over as soon as the beating was over. I knew that she was always angry. I am not sure why that was the case.   “She never had children of her own,” explained Mariah during our conversations in the kitchen whilst washing the dishes. “I don’t want to be like her. I want to have a husband and children one day.”   “Aus Mariah, do you ever think about your dreams? Do you ever think if you are still going to be able to see them through?”   “I don’t have dreams,” said Mariah. Her response was said to me plainly so, with no feeling and seemingly with no care. “Can’t you see?” she continued, “People like us can’t dream. This is the real world and, like Ntate said, when you are grown, you become more aware of certain things.”  “But Ntate would often say, ‘Hola ngwanaka, o tla di bona,’” I responded to Mariah.   “Exactly.”   “But I don’t think that Ntate meant that we couldn’t dream.”   “The problem is that you are still too young to understand Lina.” Her words and tone sounded like that I was the final thing she was to say to me.   Dawn came with a loud bang on the door.   “Polisie! Maak oop de deur!”   Mariah opened the door as instructed and in entered a large, Afrikaner policeman. He demanded to speak to my father. The two walked out of the house and, after a short while, my father returned and did not say anything to us. He walked out again with his passbook in his hand. He was obviously upset. After a short while, my father came in from the brief meeting with the officer.   “See what I mean?” said Mariah, and she walked away from me to the bedroom to get ready for work. I kept thinking about what Mariah said. I wanted to go to nursing college one day. I wanted to go on an airplane. I want a big house, a picket fence and a yard. I want to get married one day. I want.   “Lina!” Leslie shouted. “Are you done with sweeping the yard? We need to go before we arrive late at school.” I was perplexed. I knew that there was something more to life than working in a factory. I wanted a life that was different from my stepmother’s.   I thought of her again. My mother. I wonder if she had dreams. I wonder what she would have said about this. But the more I wondered, the more I realised that I really did not know her. Everything I thought about her is something I had thought to myself. I wonder what she looked like. There was no picture of her anywhere in the house. Maybe Mariah is right. Perhaps things are actually worse that they seem. I nodded, grabbed the last bead crust from the plate and headed out the door with my book tucked under my arm and walked out with Leslie.   Mistress Mabuza, the English teacher, always spoke with eloquence. She always told us stories of her days at Fort Hare University. “The only Black university in South Africa,” she would always say with pride. Her esteem of the “George” language made it easier for me to enjoy school. Perhaps I should be a teacher. If I am to be a teacher, I could finish school, go to Fort Hare, and go on an airplane.   “Lina...” an echo-like voice called for me. “What is the answer to question two?”   I panicked. I had slipped again into my thoughts without realising. “Ma’am?” I replied to Mistress Mabuza. A couple of giggles were heard in the classroom. A disappointed stare from my favourite teacher was more embarrassing than the laughs of my classmates. Realising my fault, I fixed my posture and sat up straight, so as not to miss any more of the lesson. A few minutes later, Mistress Mabuza was interrupted by the clanging sound of the bell.   “Lethobane, remain in class.” Her beckoning eyes and the sound of her summons was scary. She usually called me Lee, but somehow her formality assured me that she was concerned.   When the class finally cleared out, she came closer to my seat and sat on my table. Her perfume smelled like a summer’s day rose. She was beautiful, more than that she was intelligent. I had never met a black woman like her.   “Is everything alright?”   “Ma’am?” I replied as if I did not hear what she asked.   “Are you okay? You seemed very distracted. I know that the riots in Orlando are scary. We are living in very tense times. Lina, you are one of my best students, and I know that you are capable of achieving great things in the future.”   “Ma’am, my brother and I use the back route behind the train station to get to school and to go back home, so we are not really affected by any rioting. It’s just that…” I choked.   “Yes, it’s okay, you can talk to me. Sandwich?” She pulled out her skaftin right from her satchel under her arm.   “Yes please.” It was a peanut butter and jam sandwich, and I gobbled it down, and before I knew it, Mistress’ smile changed to a blank stare.   “When was the last time you ate Lina?”   I was embarrassed. “I ate before coming to school, Mistress.”   “Oh, Okay. Well, I am glad you enjoyed it. So, you were about to tell me something?”   “Yes, mistress. There was a policeman who came looking for my father this morning and that scared me. I left this morning and my father was still upset.”   “He is embarrassed. You see Lina, South Africa is at war. There is so much hate in the air,” she replied as she glanced up at the tin roof. My eyes could not help but follow her glance. She laughed. “Of course, I don’t mean that literally. I mean that in a figurative sense but… actually in a very real sense. A while ago, we had to leave the township to really see the hate against Abantu. But now, the hate knocks on our doors. One day and I hope soon, hate will go away. Love is always stronger than hate. Hate eats away your mind, but love ignites the heart.”   “Ma’am?” I said to her, sounding even more confused. She laughed. Her dimpled and pearly white smile came out.   “Apartheid, segregation, discrimination and poverty are all hate. They all oppress people, while benefitting others.”   “So Ma’am, do you think that one day this will all be over?”   “We sure hope so,” she interjected. “What do you want to be when you grow up?”   “I don’t know yet. I want to go on airplane.”   She laughed again. “That is what you want to do, not what you want to be.”   “I think I want to be a teacher Ma’am, and a nurse.”   She chuckled again. “Well, then Ma’am, Sister Lina Lethobane, you can be anything. Do not be afraid to defy anything or anyone that tries to stop or talk you out of your dreams.”   Her sincerity as she said those words to me was very heavy. She didn’t blink as she said that. She smiled and patted me on the back. The bell rang. The learners came in trickles and she moved away slowly to her table with a grin on her face.  Afterschool came. This time, the sky was blue. It was very warm outside. “Love is always stronger than hate,” I kept repeating those words.   “What!?” questioned Leslie, who was walking behind me as I was heading for the gate.   “Nothing,” I replied to him. “Leslie, when I grow up, I want to be like Mistress Mabuza.”   “Hmph!” he scoffed. “Let’s hurry up, I want to go to the grounds with my friends later on.”  Afterschool had come and for the first time, when it came, I was happy. I wanted to tell Mistress Mabuza about my mother, and I knew that one day I would.
