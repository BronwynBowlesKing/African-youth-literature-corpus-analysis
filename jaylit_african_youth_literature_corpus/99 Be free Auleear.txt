Be free     Be free  Be free to fail  Be free to avail bizarre opportunities  Be free to play with your creativity  Be free to slay among normal ones  Be free to sway your hips to the tune of freedom and uncalculated decisions  Be free to dislocate your brain for some time  Be free to relocate your heart  Somewhere more peaceful  Somewhere where you feel at ease  Tease yourself with some more awkwardness  Strive to push every limit  Do not even think to quit  Because when the fire of obsession is lit  It burns all that comes in its way    Pray to become stronger  Not only in the form of biceps and triceps  But also to control your urges  Pray to stop yourself to dominate your mortal body  Pray to deepen your thoughts and strengthen your soul
