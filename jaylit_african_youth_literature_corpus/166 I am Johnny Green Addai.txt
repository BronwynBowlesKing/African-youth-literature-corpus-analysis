I am Johnny Green                                                                                      DAY ONE     Sitting alone on my patio one afternoon, I put down my joint and heaved a sigh. A butterfly came, landing on the mound of weed next to my laptop. I took that as a bad sign. Perhaps this marks the beginning of my writer’s block, I thought. Nevertheless, I continued working on my manuscript, on words of poetry I still remember:                                                             I grasp at the shards                                            Through the hot sands of another day                                                  Without burning my fingertips                                                         On unrealized promise.        Unsatisfied with these words, I deleted everything. My fingers were ready but my imagination had nothing. I shut down my laptop and grabbed the joint, putting my lighter to good use. Then, laying on my seat, I took a long drag.        I had only two weeks to submit a rewrite of my novel; my agent wasn’t extending the deadline anymore.     “It still needs more work,” she claimed, having read my first draft. “There are certain weaknesses with the structure of your story you must change.”      Unfortunately, I was in the habit of taking my privileges for granted. Only after I had risen from my seat with a sharp sting on my ass-cheeks did I realize I’d been sitting buck naked this whole time, a desperate move to re-gain my writing mojo.       My living room looked creepy and filthy from all angles. Many cigarette butts, overflowing ashtrays, and empty liquor bottles crowded the front table and the floor. I was watching Scarface for about the millionth time, enjoying every minute of it as though it were my first. After a while, I grabbed my leather kit and opened it. There were handy wipes, a hand sanitizer, little vials of cologne, Visine, mouthwash, breath mints, and a pair of scissors. I opened the lid of a capsule and poured out some greens. After setting apart the sticks and seeds, I pulled out a sheet of Rizla, and rolled myself another one.     Whenever people asked about my habits, I always evaded giving a direct answer, being of the mind that a person responds to such questions from the crust, to the mantle, down to the core. I had had my fair share of substance abuse. Those were days like lost dogs. A person felt more compelled these days, amidst a dying economy, to stop following conventions and bandwagons, desisting all dreams, all passions and lifelong journeys.      I was drinking orange juice when the call came. I had been expecting Bill’s call since two in the afternoon. When my phone finally rang, I stared at it and let it ring some more, as though I was teaching it a lesson for keeping me waiting. I answered the call and, saying nothing right away, just listened.     “Wossop chaley? I dey your house ein front oh,” Bill said to me.     I told him I’d be right there and went to get dressed for our journey.      We were driving across town, looking cool in our sunglasses. The sun was just about to set. I plunged onto a motorway and turned down the Hip-hop music Bill had increased to the highest volume. We hadn’t shared a word when he reached for the tuner, yet I was sure he did it to keep himself entertained, not to reduce any awkward silence. It was a two-way silence between two friends who had natural camaraderie. Bill was used to my having moments of silent reflection, especially while driving. We had our differences. We had a lot in common too. He was everyone’s go-to guy when it came to getting a move on; a certified hustler.      “So what be the modus for the day?” I asked him, as he rolled a spliff.     “Your man dem say som move, but dem give me vague details,” he responded.     “Dem no tell you what I dey do for this whole equation inside?”      “At all,” Bill replied.       We were to meet up with Fish and Latiff at a Shell filling station somewhere in Kokomlemle. They arrived looking tough as usual. Latiff wore an all-white djellaba, a duffle bag hanging over his shoulder. Fish wore a polo shirt and denim shorts. These two were known as the best of comrades and were quite often mistaken as brothers. It was said that wherever one was spotted, the other was just around the corner.      Before we resumed our journey, I insisted that Fish and Latiff give me more information about the location to which we were headed.      “Oh, we just dey go Aburi side,” Fish said to me.     “Which side of Aburi?” I asked.      “Som side we no fit talk, unless we show you as we dey go,” Latiff responded just to fob me off.     Their sentences, in this way, always made up for each other. Whenever Fish and Latiff proposed a road trip, they did so with such devious attitudes that one could only suspect they had hidden agendas.     “What we dey go do for Aburi? And what e dey your bag inside?” I asked Latiff, looking at him with shrewd eyes.      “Chaley, you be lie detector? Why all these questions?”        Before sundown, we set off from Kokomlemle and were en route to Aburi. Everyone chipped in some money for gas, I could not afford to bear another cost on their account.   My Audi was no more than a hotbox of hashish and marijuana plumes as we sped, with a floating sensation, along the two-lane Kumasi highway. Flanked on my right of the interstate was a motorway heading our direction, and on my left, another highway going the opposite course. The moonlight looked unblemished across the road as lots of heavy-duty trucks zipped past us and a vast complex of poorly-planned housing developments stretched off on both sides. Further inland towards a main intersection, we branched left in the direction of Berekuso village. Although in our possession we had a quart of rum and a bottle of whiskey, Fish was of the opinion that it was only right we added onto our collection. Everyone concurred, and so we stopped on the way for more drinks at the liquor store. At the cashier’s post I saw my reflection on the counter. My eyes were red and my skin looked pale. In spite of this my clothes were dirty. In fact, I was very repulsive. I tried not to breathe on the cashier, and without a ‘thank you’, I hurried out immediately after the transaction.    The rural community of Berekuso connects with Aburi through a narrow bush-road filled with deadly potholes. It takes a driver over forty minutes to arrive at Aburi. The road was also known as a hideout for thieves and harm-doers and so it was deemed unsafe at night. Once we got to the bush-road, the drifting sensation with which we began our voyage gave way to a new sensation of running on a treadmill, going nowhere. Then I suddenly heard an awful roar. A shadow fell on the world as the sky became full of huge bats swooping over dark, grey clouds. Bats? What in heaven’s name were they up to in this ungodly hour and at these parts of the tropics? Everything then went completely silent again. And I wondered briefly whether what just happened, happened in reality at all, or in my head.     The guys took no notice of my reaction to the flying animals. They were busily having discussions about various violent experiences they had had. This was a normal topic for Fish and Latiff, whose language never wandered far from ‘damage’ and ‘demolish’:      “Som foolish trotro driver ever scratch we for N-1 make we pursue am erh, that day come see where the power lies,” Fish begun. Latiff recalled the story and carried on: “We cross am noor the driver get down boot! He fool papa! I collect ein key and phone all from the car inside!” Latiff laughed.      “I hear noor your man smash the side-mirrors! FIIIIM! FIIIIM!!”     “Hoh, I no shia am body kraa! I break ein side mirrors san smash ein windscreen! I san take the mate ein head smash the bonnet make ein blood all smear ma shada top! Aboalaidat! Next time he go take ein morda come scratch my car, foolish man!” Fish said all this with grave malice, and Bill laughed all along. After their shocking discussions they talked about many more things: about the past events of an unforgettable rave night, about a fast-approaching heavy-weight boxing match, and about the heavy rain clouds that had just begun to form.   Around nine o’clock we arrived at a rural community called Akuapem. It was at the hub of Aburi’s motorway network. Aburi is well-known for its many highlands, favourable climatic conditions and the hospitality of its natives. Many tourists from all over the world arrive here each year for these reasons. In the unique history of its development, the Basel missionary, Andreas Riis, was the first to settle. Other missionaries followed soon after. A large number of which established various churches and advocated the construction of the Aburi-Accra road. There was a boulevard that run along a cliff where the air was hard to breathe and the foul smell of choked gutters rode with its breeze. Several narrow streets were lined with ramshackle structures, jammed together with thatch roofs and iron sheets.      I parked my car at the foot of a forest hill called Abetema, and while we continued the journey on foot, past a narrow footpath that meandered through the heart of the forest, Fish and Latiff finally came round to explaining the motive behind our journey. We were headed for the home of a man named Alaska. A drug-dealing associate of theirs who had spent over two decades in ‘the game’ and apparently just retired. They respected him a lot. And in their opinion, the man was too experienced to be put out to pasture from their line of work.       “If I tell you say this be the guy who dey supply most of the louds for town, you go believe me?” Fish asked. “Oh why not?” said Bill. “Sumbro he dey stay Aburi hill top dier why he no go deal?” “He no be dealer oh,” Latiff pointed out. “He be supplier. You dey barb? Difference dey. He get greenhouse den U.V lights all. He dey do am indoors.”         “So why he wan shun the business?” I asked.       “Hmm, this matter be too deep,” Fish said. “Why?” I asked again.      “All dey mong we dey go ein der,” Latiff responded. “He call me yestee say he get somtin give we so make we come.”      “This one dier som inheritance for cry oh. Anaa?”      “That be all you know, kwasia!” Fish retorted to Bill.       “I get feeling say he go give we som block. If not he go take ein merchandise som dash we.”     “Which kind merchandise?” I asked.      “You dier you dey ask questions oh.”      “Make you no shiver, whatever be the case we go sort you,” Fish told me. “If it turns out to be dope we go sell give you then give you the money. Unless you want sell am yourself.”   The prospect of earning from this deal was tempting enough. You see, my utility bills were long overdue, and I needed money. Nonetheless, I felt ambushed and taken for granted, and I realized how much I had trifled with my own priorities.    About halfway up the hill, the heavy rain clouds seemed to say now is the time to teach these fools a lesson. Thunder rumbled with a deep voice, followed by flashes of lightning. We were forced to take shelter under a tree. At first nobody spoke for a while. Then I decided to break the silence by plunging once more into the subject of Alaska:      “So Alaska anytime he get visitors, this be the stress they for go through?” I asked, wiping my face with the back of my hand. “You think say e be joke?” Latiff chuckled.      “But how road no dey wey he dey stay mansion inside?” Bill asked.      “Massa, you get sense pass am?” replied Latiff. “Are you calling him a fool for building his house here or what?”      “How long has he lived here?” I asked.      “More than ten years now,” Fish replied.   Latiff crooked his finger and drew it over his eyes to clear the water from his face.       “You know say som time ago I get som hint say Alaska wan quit?” Fish said to Latiff. “But I no take am serious.” “Really? When that?” Latiff asked.     “Oh like two years ago. I dey kai waa. That day he come back from Nogokpo wey we jam am make he prepare som akpl3 give we.”   “Yeah I dey kai that day. But na where I dey the time he hint you?”      “That time na you bed. Me and am yarn throughout the night.”   “And what was the hint exactly?” I asked.   “He said something about life being like track and field events; he feared he may be approaching the finish line of his own race.”       “You sure say e no be dying he dey die?” This was Bill talking.       “At all,” Fish responded. “It be the job noor. It be like that time na ein wife dey preg plus ein first kiddie, Zion.”        “Of course. I mean what do you expect?” Bill took a beat. “He get wife, he get kiddie, he get money, he get house. You no fit hustle forever.” He blew his nose and rubbed it with the back of his hand. “Who tell you say you no fit hustle forever?” Latiff raised his voice.      “So you go take this business go your grave inside?” Bill teased. “If the old man taya, make he bed erh? Money no be everything. No be everybro he go fit kill ein body sekoff dough like you.”      “Kwasia! Then what you dey do for here?” Latiff was vexed. “If you no dey luv money go house erh? What you dey do for bush inside at twelve midnight?”     We were all soaking wet when we finally arrived at Alaska’s home. The rain had diminished, and the shrill tremor of forest insects was heard. The compound was modest, sitting on a few acres. There were neat rows of ornamental flora and a pleasant vista of the skyline.  I was at a threshold waiting to open the door to a new chapter of waywardness. In my mind, Bill was right about the need to draw a line between greed and morality. But Latiff had put him in his place by pointing out the hypocrisy in his words.     We had travelled a long way. And it all boiled down to money in the end. The Good Book says: the love of money is the root of all evil. But the lack of it yields as much evil too. Perhaps I was justified for taking a desperate measure in a desperate time. But the road to riches has no end, and this was not the end of our road, this was merely the beginning of another journey – a race in fact. And though it may appear we ride or die together in solidarity, every man knew he stood for himself in his own quest for freedom.                                                                      DAY TWO      I had done very little work on my manuscript. My writer’s block was getting worse by the day. I could feel myself sinking within depths of incapacity. At times I blamed my laziness and tried to put an end to it but such resolves were always short-lived. I had made it a point to let writing take up most space in my life, no matter how my circumstances change. But these days whenever I sat facing my laptop, my motivation to write came only from my body and not my soul. But how can one be productive when his flesh is willing and his mind lacks inspiration?        My agent had pointed out certain ‘structural weaknesses’ in my story and, being an editor herself, suggested some changes meant to give my novel a more ‘conventional’ touch. She made it clear however, in the course of our correspondence, that I, the author, had overall creative control; it would be wrong for my work to be compromised by her coercion.      I had put off reading her e-mail long enough and now the day of reckoning had come. And so I read her letter out loud to myself:       Johnny,      Going through your novel again, it’s clear you are your own protagonist, and so of course you’d have a strong opinion of who he is and how he should behave. However, the drawn-out fashion with which he outlines your narrative is not too satisfactory. Try having the plots move at a quicker pace and let’s discuss on Monday.                                                                                                                                                        Esme-Barnes         Simply breaking the news of my inability to meet her deadline was uncalled for. Also, the idea of absenting myself from our next meeting was out of the question as I was already guilty of such misconduct. If only I had half as much conviction as Mrs Barnes, I would have replied her e-mail without biting the words: your suggestion is duly noted, but I prefer my work remains the same, save for a few minor changes. But one does not write about such matters. They would have to be broken down gently in conversation.   I re-ignited my joint and leaned against the wall. After two or three tokes, I knocked the smouldering head out and stored what was left for another time. Bill and I had agreed to meet at a residential diner at Haatso. We were to head to town thereafter for business.    The evening slant of the sun at twilight turned the sky a reddish-gold colour as we weaved in and out of traffic on the road to East-Legon. We were bumping over pot holes, squinting our eyes now and again from the sun’s glare.      “So where you hide the merch’ for?” Bill asked me, his eyes glued to his iPhone. I gave him a dirty look to which he was oblivious. “It dey ma boot inside,” I replied curtly.      “You sure say water no go enter like last time?” I did not dignify this with a response. Bill jumped at every opportunity to remind me about the one time our merchandise got damaged by my mistake (I had hidden them in a secret compartment in my trunk which unfortunately got flooded by rainwater). This was our third or so business trip since Latiff and Fish granted us some amount of drugs to sell at our discretion. We apportioned a minor volume for our personal use and were selling the greater remainder to certain designated buyers of our choosing. The drugs were kept at my place - a kilo of high-grade marijuana, seventy-five pills each of Molly and Ecstasy, and a bag full of magic mushrooms. Thanks to the profits I had made so far, I paid off my utility bills as well as the costs for the upkeep of my car. Now all I had on me was a hundred and fifteen cedis plus some loose coins.        “Guy, what and what you say Oga go buy again?” I asked Bill. He seemed bothered. “This be like the hundredth time you dey ask me this question.”       “I dey do calculations for ma head inside that be why,” I said. Bill shook his head before responding: “He say make we just come. Nothing spoil.”        “What if we reach ein yard wey the merchandise I take come no be the merchandise he dey want?”        “Why? Which merch’ you take come?” He asked.       “Which merch’ I take come?” I echoed. “Which merch’ you figa say I take come?”    Bill hesitated for a moment and said: “I gave you the benefit of the doubt brethren.”           “The benefit of your Morda!” I yelled, at which point he spoke in his defence:        “This no be the first time we dey deal plus Oga.”        “Oga no be the only person we dey deal with tonight. Abi you mention som Nicky babe like that?” I asked.        “Naa. That linking no be confirmed.”        “Waa look! Wey you no tell me for phone top? Rydee e check like we over-equip wanna body.” Bill reached for the aux cable and connected his iPhone. The ensuing bars of a Jay-Z track now blared through the speakers. “Ma guy,” he said, bumping his head to the beat. “It be like say you make paranoid small, you for relax.”       We drove past an elegant boulevard and soon arrived at Bethel Villa; a massive residence made of premium brick. Home to the Honourable Sunday Okoli, otherwise known as Oga Sunday, it held a more supreme ornament than any other dwelling within the community. There was an on-going festivity in and out of the compound: many posh cars were parked outside and loud, Afro beat music wafted in the air. I drove my Audi back and forth in an effort to park in between two cars. At the same time Bill called Oga to inform him about our arrival.       “How far now?” Oga’s voice boomed over the loudspeaker. “We dey your house ein front, chairman,” Bill answered. “Oya, come inside. You no see party for ground? Or you want make I take ma back come carry you enter?” Bill was visibly thrilled at this invitation. He sprung out of my car, walked to the rear, popped my trunk and hauled out the merchandise.       The evening air was cool and pleasant. Several groups of men and women sat together at tables. Others stood in twos and threes sipping beers and whiskeys. A number of men wore suits, but most sported what appeared to be the uniform of the occasion: very expensive Agbadas and Batakaris with intricate designs. There was an unmistakable air of covetousness; we were clearly in the midst of bandits. The Honourable Sunday Okoli was a prominent man in the Nigerian community. His businesses span over a wide range of activities - one could hardly know the extent of his wealth, much less the details of his dealings. I imagined his home as some sort of embassy for bandits, gameboys and con artists.    When Oga came to the door he was already intoxicated. On seeing us he rushed forward and gave us both hugs. His wife and two children joined in this excited welcoming. It felt quite unusual. “Oya come in now,” he said. “I wait you taya. This house na your own.”    A greasy looking man had seemed unfriendly once we entered the sitting room. There were a few other men smoking cigarettes. Oga who had excused himself now arrived with a tray and a pair of scissors and handed this to Bill to start processing some buds. The greasy looking man now broke into a broad smile, the gap in his teeth looked like a vacant plot in a slum. “What you guys go drink?” Oga asked politely. “We get whiskey, Alomo and palm wine.”          “I’ll take palm wine,” I said. Bill ordered whiskey, and Oga instructed one of his stewards to serve us. “See this yeye man oh,” he said jovially to Bill. “Today you come ma house dey drink whiskey. How many times I don tell you to visit?”   “I no wan disturb you, that be why,” said Bill modestly. “Which kind disturbance? Oya what dey go on? Weytin you bring for me?”      “Today I come full volume oh,” Bill replied.   Oga drew up the sleeves of his robes and re-adjusted himself on his seat.           “Na so?” He chuckled. “Your mandem fit ron tins,” said Bill. “There’s plenty for all.” Bill motioned to the duffle bag on the floor and Oga instructed another one of his stewards to take it to the adjoining room. Our drinks arrived soon enough. The young man handed me a colander, raised the pot on his left knee and poured out palm wine. I gulped it down, waiting for the voice in my head to pronounce it good or bad. The voice spoke and it was good. “Today na good day,” said Oga. “The boys all confirm.”     “That’s what’s up.” I said excitedly. Our conversations digressed from this to that and then finally to the notion of man rising from ‘rags to riches’. Bill spoke first – it was he who brought up the topic – but the best insight came from Oga himself, who amongst us had a personal experience on the matter. He started with a saying, and I quote: “There’s a fine line between what matters, what doesn’t, and what we think matters but doesn’t.” His point being: should a man maintain the illusion that the most important things in life are ‘money’ and ‘power’, such a man lives in a vacuum. He likened an order of the true essence of life to a pyramid ranked in levels from the apex to its base. At the base dwells the carnal ideals our society worships. And at the apex dwells true knowledge and wisdom that could only be attained by virtue. Naturally I found this ironic coming from a rich man, but Oga had not always been rich. In fact, good fortune only smiled on him a couple of years ago. “If na one thing I learn in this my forty-five years of living,” he went on to say, “It be say nothing happens for nothing. There is always a cause and effect to everything, no matter how abstract or tangible.”      Bill excused himself to answer a phone call and returned with a flurry of excitement. Something had come up, he said, and we had to leave. Although Oga had left with his characteristic jovialness to the adjoining room to bring back our bag, I could tell he was disappointed, if not offended, by our sudden decision to go. As soon as Oga was out of earshot Bill said to me: “Chaley, it be the Nikki babe wey call oh.” “You dey lie!” I replied in disbelief.      “I make wild, guy.” He explained: “She say she need som grade so make I come ein der. I tell am say me and ma guy bi dey walk, wey she say no yawa, she sef som ein girl too dey.”    When Oga came back, our bag was emptied out; it appeared his people had purchased all our merchandise. We had made more money in these past few hours than in all our days of selling.     Nikki’s apartment was a two-bedroom suite on the twenty-seventh floor of The Villagio Condominium. It had a view that embraced the sparkling bright lights of the city. We got there around nine o’clock and Nikki was already performing a seductive dance to some acoustic music. Her friend Operbia was quietly seated when Bill introduced me as his ‘writer-friend’.        “Really? What kind of stuff do you write?” Nikki asked me.        “Creative stuff, pretty much.” I replied coolly.        “Sounds vague,” she snickered. “Any works of yours I might have seen?”       “I’m working on my first novel,” I said.       “Oh okay, and how’s that coming?”   I told her everything was quite alright except my writer’s block.        “Don’t worry,” Nikki said. “It happens sometimes.”   Her music had been playing since we entered; an acoustic guitar with keyboard tunes and soulful vocals. Nikki was a sort of B-list celebrity in the Ghanaian music scene. Come to think of it, there was some hype circulating around her at the time, but it did not occur to me then.     By now a smoking bong had been going round. Operbia did not indulge. She hadn’t shared a word with us yet, but I could tell she was listening to our every word. She was thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. She wore a bodycon dress with a geometric pattern print on it. Her skin looked silky-smooth, and her fingernails cherry red. There was something about her – perhaps it was the dress she wore, perhaps it was her unassuming nature – it sparked in me an irresistible urge to have her at the mercy of my loins.       “Are you guys hungry?” Nikki asked us. “We’ve got Kenkey and fish.”      “Bring am make we chop!” Bill replied, a little too eagerly.   The ladies went into the kitchen and came back with Kenkey and a bottle of red wine. Operbia had garnished my plate with diced vegetables and filled my glass with wine. She then joined me a few seats away at the dining table. “Thank you so much,” I said, smiling at her. Then I started wolfing down the food. Her eyes were on me the whole time.       “Can I ask you a question?” This was the first thing she said to me. “What do you get when you smoke?” she asked. A fish bone got caught up in my throat and I tried without success to swallow it down. “But I didn’t answer your first question.” I argued, trying to conceal my surprise. “What is it?” She asked.       “No, you can’t ask me a question.”        “Very funny,” she said with a horrid, sarcastic tone. Then she picked up a magazine from the table and began to read. I was about to remind her that it’s rude to read in front of your guests when she said: “Smoking is bad for you,” without even looking up at me.       “Everything’s bad for you these days,” I replied.       “I’ve been trying to get my cousin to stop,” Operbia continued. “But she’s stubborn just like you.”       “Who’s your cousin?” I asked. Operbia made a head gesture towards Nikki, who by now had snuggled up to Bill in the living room.   When I was done eating she came for my plate and went into the kitchen, wiggling her backside. It was as perfect as her front. And so I followed her, admiring each step she took and the way her slippers clapped against the soles of her feet. I offered her a hand with the dishes but she maintained an insistent “No!” I could only stand there and watch. After a while I moved closer to her, tempted to put my arm around her waist, but I decided it might be premature.         “What do you do for a living?” I asked instead. “What’s your story?”        “My story?” She repeated. “You’re the writer, not me.”         “Ei, why do you have something against writers or what?”       “Of course not,” she said.        “You think writing is a waste of time, don’t you?”        “I was only joking please don’t chew me.”        “You never answered my question though;” I said. “What do you do?”   Operbia told me she had just completed University. She would begin her national service next year in a couple of months. “National service where?” I asked.     “I’d be working as an administrative clerk at ministries.”     “And after your service what’s next?”      “My dad says I should go to law school. But I don’t know, I might start a business or something.”    I could tell Operbia was a most complicated woman. Her voice carried the confidence that comes with beauty and brains. With a girl like her what was required was a gentle prodding at regular intervals, without any rushed actions that are bound to give away your intentions.   The living room was now empty with Nikki and Bill gone. Operbia and I sat on the sofa having ‘philosophical’ conversations for what seemed a full hour. Her theories and ideas were deeply-rooted and, though difficult to admit, somehow resonated with me. We would be talking, for instance, about metaphysics, and she would say: “Science and technology is a product of Alchemy. And Alchemy a product of sorcery and magic.” Or, perhaps, our discourse would veer towards the subject of divinity, and she will say: “Surely, there is a God, but there are many other gods, and many other realms of existence.”    I decided it was time to quit this pussy-footed business and be as direct and straightforward about my intentions as possible. What’s the worst that could happen? A rejection?  Big deal! You’d get over it in the morning, I told myself. So I moved closer to her and called her name “Operbia,” looking deep in her eyes. “I know we only just met and this might sound cliché but…I’m feeling some type of connection here.”      There was a long and awkward silence. Operbia sat up on the sofa:      “You don’t know me,” she responded softly. “I’m not who you think I am.”       “I’m already fond of you.” I told her. “I’ve got love for you right here, right now. Isn’t that enough?”     The smile on her face looked faintly ironical, as though she had been wondering what took me so long. “What are you trying to say, Johnny?” She asked, smiling.      “Operbia you’re killing me. I’m just trying to capitalize on the heat of this moment. You’re not a small girl.”      “What heat,” she joked. “Anyway, what do you want from me?” I smiled and asked “What do you think of loving in the moment?” I don’t remember who kissed who first, but she was in my arms the next moment. She had pressed her body against mine, her perfume smelt like nothing I’d ever smelt, her juicy breasts and mass of dark hair got stuck in my mouth. She had clasped her arms around my neck and her feet around my waist. She called me darling, loved one, sweetheart. And she pulled me down to the ground, bursting with energy. It was more than I had bargained for. A strong sense of pride rushed down my spine, and I was glad this was happening, for I had for too long been without a woman. Operbia picked herself up from the floor, pulling something out of her hair. She sat facing me, and said:         “Johnny darling, we can’t have sex tonight. I’m sorry if that’s not enough for you.” I suppose I should have burst into tears or something, but I didn’t. “Sorry for what?” I asked. “I’ll take whatever you’ll give me.”                                                                   DAY THREE      For three or four weeks I had been bracing myself for this moment. I walked into Mrs Barnes’ library that afternoon thinking I was fully prepared for our meeting. It was Christmas season. The opulent library looked festive with coloured bright lights and a Christmas tree. After waiting for a while, I decided to check out some of her books. There was a decorative set of English encyclopaedia, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf and a couple other high-society novels written by women.   I flipped through a few pages of the encyclopaedia and settled back down to read it closely. I was a little tipsy. You see, I can’t speak for every drinker, but whenever I take alcohol in adequate amounts, my body language flows more lucidly, removing all signs of anxiety.    Over the faint sound of footsteps, I rose to my feet, putting the encyclopaedia away. Mrs Barnes was standing at the doorway. For a mother of three, she still looked very well-kept. She carried authority in every inch of her bearing, and seemed perfectly capable of holding her own next to a beautiful young girl. Mrs Barnes was the sole proprietor of H-CONNECT, a very reputable HR firm in Ghana. Being passionate also about African literary arts, she had recently become an editor and an agent.       “Hello Johnny,” she greeted me, making her way into the library and sitting on a red velvet chair. She had a bunch of files in hand. “Hello Mrs Barnes,” I grinned, sitting back down.      “I hope I didn’t keep you waiting.”           “No problem here ma’am,” I said.      “Good to know. How was your weekend? And how’s the writing coming?” I told her my weekend was awesome and the writing was coming along just fine.      “Okay, let’s get right to it then,” she said. “I don’t know if you received my last e-mail? I expressed concerns about your ‘pacing’.”      “My pacing with which part of my story exactly?” I was quick to ask in my defence. Mrs Barnes had already sensed a certain defiance in my attitude, which did not look well for the rest of our conversation.         “Okay, Johnny, I’m sure this goes without saying, but you and I;” she accompanied the words ‘you and I’ with a gesture of her fore-finger. “We’re on the same side here.”        “I know we’re on the same side…”       “Let me finish, please” Mrs Barnes interjected. “Don’t get me wrong, Johnny, I’m a big fan of being unconventional. But in any case some conventions must apply. You have written your story in a certain ‘drawn-out’ fashion that makes it feel monotonous, at some point.”       “Monotonous? How?”       “Your narrator is isolated throughout the novel. All he does is talk about himself and his surroundings. There’s a lot of unnecessary information that does not push your story forward. At first he strikes me as a cool and eccentric character, but then there’s about three or four pages describing a very long scene in the lavatory. And no one wants to see that.”       “You are talking about my first draft, which has changed a great deal.” I began. “And even Johnny isn’t the only character in that draft. Other characters come in eventually. Besides he is an introvert; it’s only right he spends time by himself.”       “I counted the number of times you used the word ‘I’ in chapters one, two and three. Do you know what it was?” She asked.       “Unless you tell me,” I responded.       “Seventy-two times.” Mrs Barnes let this sink in. “It means your readers must endure reading ‘I…I…I’ over and over again at the beginning of your book. How can you expect them to keep turning the pages?”       “I can’t please everybody.” I said, ignoring her valid point. “I don’t expect everyone to read or love my story. Every novel is basically an acquired taste. And even all these issues you’ve mentioned have been rectified in my second draft. I’ve introduced the other characters much earlier in the story, so it doesn’t feel as monotonous as before.”     “Okay, well that’s good.” She smiled shrewdly. “So when can I get a copy of this second draft?”       “You’ll have to give me more time please,” I said. “I’m not done yet.”       “On a scale of one to ten, how far will you say you’re done?” Mrs Barnes looked in my eyes, as though she sought the answer embedded in my soul.       “I would say eight point five.”        “Eight point five? How interesting.” She knew I was lying.      Just then a car pulled up outside and a most sophisticated-looking young woman walked in on our meeting. Mrs Barnes introduced her to me as Miss Mabel Akoto. She had arrived that very minute from the Airport and hadn’t even gone home to wash off the weariness of her journey, she said. I thought she looked stunning enough with all her fatigue.       “Are you the novelist Esme keeps telling me about?” Miss Akoto asked me as soon as Mrs Barnes left the library to answer a phone call.       “Aspiring novelist.” I corrected her. “I’m still working on it.”       “I see,” she nodded. “But do you think novels are still relevant today? Do people actually still read novels at all these days?” I tried to hide the resentment which must have flooded my face. It was as if the question, having lingered behind my subconscious, had now finally broken free thanks to her. My feelings must have shown. Miss Akoto leaned forward to explain:  “Please don’t take any offense. I’m only making a general point, which I think is interesting.”       “It wouldn’t stop me from writing,” I said. “It’s a matter of principle to me.” She asked me what my novel was about and I told her it was an autobiographical story about a struggling writer trying to find the light at the end of the tunnel.       “So it’s about you?” She asked. “It’s loosely based on actual experiences.” I answered. Miss Akoto wondered if I had ever tried my hands on screenwriting. She run a film production company in the city, and they had been looking for good writers. I must confess, I was a little intimidated by her sophisticated and classy manner. The way she spoke she must have spent her childhood in England or something. I took her card and told her she will be hearing from me.   Before sunset I was out of Mrs Barnes’ mansion and on my way to Spintex, having spoken with Operbia over the phone. It was her birthday today. And she had invited me over to her house for a Christmas dinner party. Where are you? Where have you reached? I thought I told you to get here by six! Operbia sounded agitated over the phone. I told her to keep calm. I will be there shortly.      There was a strange and unreal air about the way things were turning out between Operbia and me. It was amusing and yet vaguely disturbing at the same time. I had not always felt indifferent about women. On the contrary, I had gotten quite intimate with a considerable number of women in my past. But these intimacies which I regarded as passionate were neither long-lasting nor sincere. There was always a part of me, an alter ego, which seemed to rise above it all, eyeing the other me below with cynical disdain, as I copulated in my affairs. But things were different with Operbia. We had started off intimately, and this set the tone for what was to come in our relationship. It was devoid of the kind of mind games that usually come with the approach of ‘wooing’ a girl. This was a good thing. For though it was not love at first sight, it was certainly real. In spite of this I didn’t feel I had any rightful claims on her; I had not slept with her yet, and our relationship was not based on commitment but on the warm current of whatever providence had brought us together.   Operbia came from one of the wealthiest families in the city. Their mansion was built like a manor; what it lacked in excessive spreads of land and the splendour of the English countryside, it made up for in bold exterior decorations and contemporary architecture. The living room had museum-quality art decorations and rosy grey furniture, with framed poetry and stylized Egyptian figures.    At the dinner party Operbia wore a short, beaded evening dress with hemlines and gorgeous prints. She started off nicely by thanking every one for making it to her “not so fancy” Christmas dinner party. “One of the saddest things about being born on Christmas is that you can never really tell whether people are celebrating you or Jesus,” Operbia joked and everyone laughed.      “Aaaw, too bad,” said one of the ladies, matching her words with a tilt of her head. I thought I recognized her from somewhere but I couldn’t put a finger on it.        “No offense to Jesus,” Operbia continued. “I wasn’t born in a manger but I could use some Frankincense right now.” She winked shrewdly at the other lady. It was then I remembered who she was: a schoolmate from my University.     Apart from Operbia and me there were five others in the dining room – the lady I just remembered from college whose name was Yvonne, her boyfriend Jeffrey, Operbia’s older brother Kojo, and their eldest sister Eraqua who had arrived late with her fiancé.      Dinner was rice and stew with stir fried pork and grilled chicken. I had set out with a huge appetite, so I didn’t spare the food at all. While Operbia flirted with me, her friend Yvonne did not seem too happy about this – I imagined her wondering who is this guy acting all cosy around my bestie? I tried to re-establish our connection but she did not remember me and didn’t seem to care particularly. I was very offended by this and immediately formed a poor opinion of her.   Our conversation that night started on a mild note but in no time things got heated into an intellectual debate. When the discussion turned on the harsh realities of being an up and coming artiste in today’s world I made what I still think was a most valid and timely intervention.  Operbia initially stated a generally agreeable point: that talent will never be enough for success. She went on to elaborate that one needs an enabling platform and the virtue of perfect timing as well; perfect timing involved meeting the right people at the right time, which meant having the right platforms. But she implied a role of providence in this matter and this did not sit well with Yvonne, who disagreed with Operbia for what she called ‘the Beyoncé theory.’      “I will always recommend the Beyoncé theory for every creative’s journey.” Yvonne begun. “Beyoncé’s talent wasn’t out of this world or anything, she just had the right drive, and she put in a lot of work.” Her accent had moved closer to that of an American.        “Wey na she san too get swag,” Kojo added.       “Yes, but her strongest element was the amount of hard work she put in. Her body of work is humongous.” Yvonne kept on blabbering about Beyoncé and all her attributes, and everyone else joined in this testimonial, talking about the fact that her family wasn’t broke, and that they put in a lot of work and money into her becoming a super star.        “Nobody is saying her family was broke, and nobody’s disputing her hard work.” Operbia responded back at them. “Everybody puts in work. You are talking about her staying relevant as a mainstream artist but I’m talking about the breakthrough itself. They are two different things.”         “But nothing about Beyoncé’s career involved perfect timing or luck. Her parents were her managers, and everyone else in Destiny’s child was essentially there to put her up.” Yvonne kept talking out of her ass.   It was then I had my flash of insight. It appeared the basis of our argument had veered from the struggles of an emerging artist, and now everyone was just going on and on about the superstar’s accolades. “How many artistes do you think have parents as supportive and resourceful as Beyoncé’s?” This was the first point I made. “It’s a rare case. Most of them make it without their parent’s money or support. We’re talking about the average here, you can’t expect every talent to adopt the Beyoncé theory when their families aren’t rich enough.”       “Exactly!” Operbia exclaimed, suddenly encouraged by my words. “It’s like an equation. Talent is just one factor out of a bunch of other factors.”        “Like the timing and platform factor.” I added.       “Yes!” Operbia concluded: “So you see, your Beyoncé theory only applies to artistes from privileged backgrounds.” You should have seen the two of us; it was like the red team versus the blue team. Everything I said from this point gained heightened significance. I became more than just ‘some guy’ the birthday girl had invited to their expensive dinner.     A small thing really, but it struck me all the same: after we had eaten, Jeffrey, who had clearly been aiming to put me on the spot, asked to my surprise what I said my name was again.       “It’s Johnny Green,” I told him.       “Ah! Which kind name be that?” he said this ill-manneredly, and just like that he looked away and engaged someone else in conversation. It was rude and disrespectful, but I made little of it.  When dinner was over, Operbia had a bone to pick with me. Apparently she had noticed an unfriendly tension between myself and her best friend. Yvonne. “Do you have a problem with Yvonne?” She asked me. “I don’t think she likes me.” I told her, without failing to mention how I had pegged Jeffrey also for a kind of ass. Operbia seemed to agree with me on that one.   The others had left in a bunch, and soon after, Operbia told me she wanted to go out somewhere without having to end the night so plainly. It was her birthday after all, she said. The only spot I knew was Dereko’s, a local pub I had visited some time ago around the Spintex roundabout. But Operbia objected. In the end we decided to go to the beach. “It’s such a beautiful night,” she said. “Labadi by this time sounds like a plan.”    It was a beautiful night alright. The Teshie-Nungua road to Labadi was well-lit and clear of traffic and police barriers. I branched off the main road, taking a short-cut through back streets and obscure lanes. The wind was cool on my face and the sound of my engine bounced around in the trees over our heads. Operbia who was now fed up with my Hip-Hop playlist connected her phone to the cable and played a love tune.   We got out of my car at Labadi and walked several yards down the beach.   “Are you really thinking of swimming?” I was curious. “Of course,” she replied, already pulling her dress over her head. “I’ve been waiting to do this all week.” Operbia smiled invitingly at me. She was now wearing a red bikini, toying with the idea of removing her underwear. She threw her head back and paddled her way into the water, her hair floating down to her waist. Operbia looked like a goddess from my dreams; a wild animal with fleshy figure; all hips and thighs and nipples.       “So you’re just going to stand there and gawk?” She asked me. For a moment I considered joining her in the water but a look at that dark ocean changed my mind. I took off my clothes and laid them on the ground to relax instead. “I can’t swim,” I told her. Operbia shrugged and continued floating in the gentle surf, letting herself be knocked around by the waves. Finally she struggled back up to the beach and came lying next to me. I had already rolled up a joint.       “I’ve told you to stop smoking this filth,” she said, pulling her hair into a low pony and sweeping the tail over her shoulder. “And Nikki told me you’ve been selling too. Is that true?”         “Me? Selling?” I chuckled.      “So you didn’t sell Kush to my cousin the night we met?”       “Not at all. That was Bill,” I lied. Operbia chuckled and said: “I hear you.” After a long silence she asked me how my meeting went with Mrs Barnes. “It went well actually,” I said, taking a hit from my joint. “I met this showbiz lady and took her number, possibly for a job.”      “Aaaw that’s nice.” Operbia unwrapped some chocolate from her hand bag which she broke in half, offering me one. I took her hand instead, pulling her closer. The joint I was holding fell, and we were now kneeling face to face. Her body yielded to me; wherever my hands touched seemed to melt, and her breasts was ripe and firm. I leaned forward to kiss her. Our lips clung slowly, more sensual than before. When we moved our heads apart she let out a deep sigh and stared blankly at me as I reached for the loose end of her underwear. She began to wince and recoil. And what was strange was that even as she held me close I had a vague feeling she was pushing me away at the same time. By this time I was on top of her. She had laid down on her back and slightly turned round, covering her face with both hands. Then she began to cry. It was an ugly cry; an ugly, stomach wrenching cry. I asked her what was wrong and she looked at me with vulnerable eyes. I could almost tell by instinct what had happened. I did not want to seem unmoved, and so slowly, I sat next to her so we could talk. “What is it?” I asked.      Operbia had been a victim of rape. It happened at a house party she attended some time ago. She told me she was in denial at first, thinking it was all her fault; she didn’t say “no” loud enough and she had a lot to drink that night. She gained consciousness the following morning when all she could remember was his fist down her throat to keep her from screaming. He had told her he loved her and she thought she loved him too.      “I haven’t told anyone about this,” Operbia said to me. I didn’t know what to say. My shock quickly turned into anger at what the rapist had done to her.  “Who is he?” I asked, but she seemed unwilling to tell, and I decided against pursuing the matter. I wanted to tell her everything was going to be okay, without sounding cliché. But there was an irony here; my compassion was not sincere. Deep down I was actually disappointed we weren’t having ‘sex on the beach’ that night. So much for clichés, I thought to myself. My expectation to be satisfied by a woman was desensitized, and it ran deep. I had been marred with the same sort of attitude that fosters a rape culture, the effects of which I was now facing up to, at the expense of my lover. And as this reality dawned on me, I realized that I was part of the problem, simply by being a man.
