Wait, Im afraid    I'm afraid that if I show them how  smart I am no one will like me,  its been proven to be true.  Im afraid that if I truly  learn to love myself, I mean really  embrace strengths and weaknesses  then no one else will love me,  its been proven to be true.  Im a woman and Im scared, that if I  attain all my goals then  no man will love me theyll see  me as a threat,  its been proven to be true.  But more than anything Im scared,  Im terrified that Ill meet someone  who destroys all these proven truths.
