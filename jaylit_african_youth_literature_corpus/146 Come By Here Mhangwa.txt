Come By Here      Characters  Alien/Aunt Jenesa – Danny’s estranged aunt  Danny – an enthusiastic alien hunter  Martha – a girl lost in the woods  Bon-Bon – Clynn’s girlfriend  Clynn – Bon-Bon’s boyfriend      Scene I    The stage is bare.    Enter Danny. He is carrying a heavy-looking backpack and a pair of binoculars. He is frantically looking into the binoculars around the stage.  MARTHA: (Out of view; singing ‘Khumbaya’)  Danny becomes startled and looks around for the origin of the noise.  Enter Martha singing.  DANNY: Hey! This isn’t Sunday morning Mass could you keep it down.  MARTHA: I apologise sir. I sing when I get nervous.  DANNY: Nothing to get nervous about. I bet today we’re definitely making a sighting.  MARTHA: Sighting what?  DANNY: Aliens of course! For the past few months there has been a UFO that has been spotted here and tonight when it arrives I’m going to break the news.  MARTHA: Aliens! Ah! Get me out of here, get me out of here! (Begins to sing ‘Khumbaya’)  DANNY: Hey, hey, hey. (Martha stops singing) This isn’t church, it isn’t even a Sunday.  MARTHA: It doesn’t have to be a Sunday for me to seek divine intervention and boy do I need it if this alien thing you’re talking about is real.  DANNY: What kind of alien hunter are you? You don’t want to meet aliens?  MARTHA: I’m Martha, just a simple girl. No alien hunter.  DANNY: Danny, your average alien hunter.  MARTHA: I doubt there is anything average about an alien hunter.  DANNY: There are millions of us around the world.  MARTHA: You’re the first one I’ve ever met.  DANNY: I’m sure you’ve met a ton but you just didn’t know it. So what are you doing on this perfect landing spot?  MARTHA: I’m looking for my family. We got separated when we went hiking up the  mountain. I’ve been looking for our camping site for hours.  DANNY: That’s unfortunate. I’d help you but I can’t miss this UFO landing.  MARTHA: Well I’m not surprised. Chivalry disappeared ages ago.  DANNY: Come on Martha, stay a while with me here, and I’ll help you find you’re camp when I meet the aliens.  MARTHA: You look too smart to believe in aliens.  DANNY: It’s more of certainty than belief.  MARTHA: The green monster you see in the middle of the night is your mother with her facial cream on.  DANNY: It’s not that! I’ve actually seen one at my Aunt Jenesa’s place. They abducted her four months ago.  MARTHA: That poor woman is your aunt? I read about her in the paper.  DANNY: Poor Aunt Jenesa! She should have believed me when I said her house had the right frequency and coordinates for an extraterrestrial landing.  MARTHA: You honestly think that your aunt was abducted by aliens?  DANNY: What else could it be?  MARTHA: I read a few days back that they suspect that it was a kidnapping.  DANNY: Kidnapping?  MARTHA: Yes, kidnapping. Like taking someone against their will. Kidnapping.  DANNY: Kidnapped (short pause) by aliens.  MARTHA: Oh brother.  DANNY: Try a little, just a little, to suspend your disbelief.  MARTHA: There are a lot of things I believe in but aliens aren’t one of them.  DANNY: Then if you don’t believe in aliens, you wouldn’t mind staying with me here until I get my proof.  MARTHA: (Short scream)  DANNY: Like you said, you don’t believe in them, you have nothing to fear.  MARTHA: But it’s getting late. I don’t want you to get cold out here and my family must be  worried sick. Let’s go now.  DANNY: A few minutes won’t hurt.  MARTHA: (Mumbles ‘Khumbaya’ softly)  Danny begins searching the area through his binoculars. Bon-Bon and Clynn are heard giggling off stage. Martha runs to Danny’s side.  MARTHA: What was that?  DANNY: Extraterrestrial activity!  MARTHA: Don’t say that!  DANNY: You’re the one who asked me.  MARTHA: And I needed a little comfort. (Bon-Bon and Clynn are heard giggling and talking, still off stage) It’s getting closer! We’re goners.  DANNY: No way Martha! I’m going to be rich!    Scene II  Enter Bon-Bon and Clynn.  BON-BON: This is a good spot.  CLYNN: I think we should look for another spot.  BON-BON: The further we go, the more we’ll get lost.  CLYNN: I want to get lost in your eyes sweetheart.  BON-BON: Oh! (Notices Danny and Martha). Please excuse us… we’re… we’re…  MARTHA: Lost? Aren’t we all?  BON-BON: (Looks guilty) Let’s go with that.  DANNY: It’s people like you who frighten the aliens away.  BON-BON: I beg your pardon.  DANNY: Messing around in the woods like this, you think the aliens would be happy coming to a place like this?  CLYNN: Hey! Don’t speak to my girlfriend like that mister.  DANNY: If I don’t tell her, or you, nobody will.  CLYNN: This is a public park, anybody can come here.  DANNY: The least you can do then is respect it. Lovebirds’ cliff is right next door, why don’t you go over there?  BON-BON: It’s always busy on a Friday night. I can see somebody is single. (Clynn restrains her) What are you doing here?  DANNY: I’m Danny, your regular alien hunter, and my lovely assistant Martha.  MARTHA: This isn’t a magician’s act! I’m not your assistant. (To Bon-Bon and Clynn) I’m Martha, your regular girl lost in the woods.  BON-BON: I’m Bon-Bon.  CLYNN: And I’m Clynn. Your regular ride or die power couple.  MARTHA: Your names have such a nice ring to them, almost like a sing-song.  BON-BON: We get that a lot. How did you get lost?  MARTHA: I was hiking with my family when we got separated. I’ve been looking for them for hours.  CLYNN: Then you came across this guy. Your day just gets better doesn’t it?  DANNY: Hey, I have a mission to complete here. She just came out of the blue singing campfire songs.  CLYNN: Campfire songs?  MARTHA: They soothe me.  BON-BON: Me too. They’re good for the car chases.  MARTHA: (Enthusiastically) Really? (She begins to sing ‘Khumbaya’)  BON-BON: Hey! Why not save it for later?  CLYNN: (To Danny) Perhaps when the aliens arrive.  DANNY: Why I ought to…  CLYNN: Bring it on Steve Erwin.  BON-BON: (Calming Clynn down) Clynn my love, relax.  MARTHA: Steve Erwin was an alligator hunter.  CLYNN: Same difference.  DANNY: You wait until I’m on the front page of the paper when I bust the case of the aliens that visit these woods.  BON-BON: We can make a lot of money from that actually. (Whispering to Clynn) We were going to end up on the front page of some newspaper someday anyway.  CLYNN: You have a point.  DANNY: I’m busting this case by myself. I don’t need your help. So feel free to leave!  BOB-BON: You can’t tell us to leave.  MARTHA: And you promised to help me find my campsite.  DANNY: I will! After I’m done here. (Suggestively) My lovely assistant.  MARTHA: Quiet that, you’d never find me working for you even for a million-dollar paycheck.  DANNY: You could bank a million dollars if you decide to comply with me.  CLYNN: I’m in for a million dollars!  DANNY: No ways mister, it’s for Martha and me.  CLYNN: If the aliens arrive, then we’re all entitled to the story.  BON-BON: Yeah and we want our cut.  DANNY: First you wanted to make out now you want to steal my glory.  BON-BON: Our glory (Snatches binoculars from Danny) Now how do these work? I want to look smart like those explorer babes when the news crew arrives.  MARTHA: This is not good.  CLYNN: It’s great actually, we’re going to be filthy rich!  MARTHA: Oh no!  DANNY: (Fights with Bon-Bon for the binoculars) I’m not letting you steal my life’s destiny.  BON-BON: Our life’s work Danny!  The sound of a spaceship is heard and a bright light suddenly appears on stage.  DANNY: Finally! (He grabs the binoculars from Bon-Bon) Give me that!  CLYNN: I don’t believe it.  MARTHA: Nothing good will come of this.  Martha runs behind Danny for protection. Clynn begins to exit stage slowly then Bon-Bon notices him and pulls him back.  BON-BON: You’re not going anywhere. If this is the greatest discovery in modern history you’re going to be here with me.    Scene III  Enter Alien/Aunt Jenesa. Alien/Aunt Jenesa screams on seeing Danny, Martha, Bon-Bon and Clynn.  DANNY: Do not be afraid. We come in peace. (He makes a strange sign with his hand)  BON-BON: We didn’t come from anywhere, it arrived from that spaceship. (Looking towards the wings) Nice ride! I wonder how much that is worth.  CLYNN: Enough to take care of our great-grandsons.  DANNY: (Quietly) You’re scaring it. (Loudly) We are your friends. Come by here.  MARTHA: Come by here… sure (Sings ‘Khumbaya’)  Bon-Bon, Clynn and Danny shush Martha.  BON-BON: If you’d be so kind enough as to take a few pictures with us, perhaps even an  interview, do you speak any of the Ancient languages?  DANNY: (To Bon-Bon) Do you speak any of the Ancient languages?  ALIEN/AUNT JENESA: (Mumbles)  BON-BON: Go on, don’t be shy.  ALIEN/AUNT JENESA: (Mumbles anxiously this time)  CLYNN: It’s useless trying to communicate with her. She obviously doesn’t understand us. We’ll become national heroes if we tie her up and take her to the police.  ALIEN/AUNT JENESA: Noooooooo!  MARTHA: She understands English? Isn’t that a surprise?  DANNY: You have no right to tie up another living thing and submit it to the authorities.  CLYNN: People go hunting all of the time.  DANNY: This isn’t hunting. The Earth and the universe are finally shaking hands!  BON-BON: (Stretching out her hand towards Alien/Aunt Jenesa) Speaking of which, I’m Bon-Bon and that is my boyfriend Clynn. Who would you be?  MARTHA: Don’t touch her! Who knows what radioactive ectoplasm she has on her.  ALIEN/AUNT JENESA: (Makes weeping noises)  BON-BON: Look what you’ve done, you’ve hurt her feelings. (She embraces Alien/Aunt Jenesa) She is completely harmless.  DANNY: Hey, don’t touch her. She is unfamiliar with our earthly ways.  CLYNN: And I suppose you’re familiar with her alien ways?  DANNY: I know more than you’ll ever know.  MARTHA: Boys! Why don’t we all relax? (To Alien/Aunt Jenesa) Hello far away visitor, it’s a pleasure to meet you! I’m Martha. I must say you look wonderful under the moonlight.  ALIEN/AUNT JENESA: (Mumbles) Thank you.  MARTHA: Awww you’re welcome… I like her already.  BON-BON: What brings you to Earth?  DANNY: Amateurs! You can’t be asking her questions like that. Everybody knows that they’re here to usher us into the new millennium. A new world order. (Pushes Bon-Bon and Martha away from Alien/Aunt Jenesa) Now move away!  BON-BON: (Sarcastically) Aren’t you just a gentleman?  DANNY: This isn’t about you Bon-Bon, it’s about the entire Earth’s future. (To Alien/Aunt Jenesa) Now, my name is…  ALIEN/AUNT JENESA: (Mumbles) You.  DANNY: No, my name is…  ALIEN/AUNT JENESA: (Mumbles anxiously)  Alien/Aunt Jenesa tries to run away from Danny, but Danny blocks all of her attempts by jumping in front of her.  CLYNN: She clearly doesn’t want to talk to you.  MARTHA: Have you two met by any chance?  DANNY: Of course not, this is my first alien encounter.  CLYNN: (To Bon-Bon) I find that very hard to believe.  BON-BON: She seems to know you pretty well though.  Alien/Aunt Jenesa tries one more time to run away from Danny, but he grabs her.  DANNY: I’m not letting you go!  CLYNN: She can take you back to the mothership and you can finally go to space.  DANNY: (Struggling with Alien/Aunt Jenesa) Share your secrets with me.  MARTHA: Stop hurting her.  BON-BON: She’s a living creature like me and you.  Bon-Bon and Martha pull Danny away from Alien/Aunt Jenesa.  DANNY: Hey… don’t let her get away! That’s my ten-year-old brother’s science project and my ticket to the Nobel Prize!  BON-BON: You just attacked another living creature. The only place you should be is the dog pound.  MARTHA: All nature should be respected, even if it doesn’t make sense to us.  DANNY: It doesn’t make sense to you! This makes a whole lot of sense to me! If you weren’t here to disturb me, I wouldn’t have these problems, but you had to come in between me and my mission. A weird girl who has been singing campfire songs and a sleazy couple on the run!  CLYNN: (Grinding his knuckles) That’s it buddy, it’s time to tango.  BON-BON: Go for it honey!  MARTHA: (To Danny) I would be the voice of reason but not today.  DANNY: (To Clynn) Bring it on!  Martha and Bon-Bon move away from Clynn and Danny.  ALIEN/AUNT JENESA: Alright, alright! Stop already. (Removes alien mask)  DANNY: Aunt Jenesa!  CLYNN: She’s human! (To Danny) You’re related?  DANNY: That’s my Aunt Jenesa.  MARTHA: I know her! She’s the woman who went missing. The press went crazy over her story.  BON-BON: Looks like we’ve got competition for the front page cover Clynn.  AUNT JENESA: You can have it! This wasn’t supposed to happen. I wasn’t supposed to get discovered, most of all by you!  DANNY: But I’ve missed you so much! I was going to bust the story of the mysterious spaceship and I wanted you to be proud of me.  AUNT JENESA: Congratulations! You’ve uncovered the story of the alien and that alien… is me.  MARTHA: So you’ve been living in space for nearly four months?  AUNT JENESA: Yes. It’s not that bad, they have an entire civilisation up there.  BON-BON: (Sly) You don’t say.  AUNT JENESA: Everything you need is up there. Apart from my favourite pickles! That’s why I come back once a week to stock up.  DANNY: So, after all these weeks of endless worry, you’ve been living in space all along?  AUNT JENESA: Anything to get away from you.  DANNY: What have I ever done to offend you?  AUNT JENESA: Let me not mince my words. I strongly detest you. You’re a disgrace to the family name! Running around looking for aliens like a maniac. So when one day the Frank Sinatra of aliens arrived at my front door and asked if I wanted the adventure of a lifetime, I said yes.  DANNY: But this is proof that I was right! They do exist.  AUNT JENESA: Yes they do, and there is a very handsome one waiting for me on Planet XY.  DANNY: It’s time for the truth to be revealed. I’m going to be rich!  MARTHA: And turn this world upside down in the process.  BON-BON: I’m always in for a quick buck, but this is too scary.  DANNY: This is the dawn of a new era! You’re fools not to see it!  AUNT JENESA: The aliens want nothing to do with you and your planet. They only come here on vacation, sort of like going to the zoo. These are peaceful beings that’ve created a paradise for themselves.  CLYNN: Is there anything we can do to make this up to you?  AUNT JENESA: Well… (Looks at Danny)  Danny looks around and sees that the others are looking at him. Aunt Jenesa jumps Danny. Bon-Bon, Clynn and Martha then help her with tying Danny up. Bon-Bon takes off a belt she is wearing and Martha takes off her scarf or headband, which are then used to tie up Danny's legs and hands. Clynn takes out a handkerchief and stuffs it in Danny's mouth.  AUNT JENESA: That should do it!  MARTHA: Do you think it’s safe to leave him here?  AUNT JENESA: He’s no harm.  CLYNN: What if he tells the police?  AUNT JENESA: And say what? I was ambushed in the woods by my aunt from Venus. They’ll never believe him. (Aside) Even if it is the truth.  BON-BON: Well that solves the mystery of aliens visiting Earth. (To Martha) How about we  help you find your camp?  CLYNN: We can give you a ride when we get out of here.  AUNT JENESA: How about I help you find your campsite? I have a spaceship that can scan this area in seconds.  MARTHA: That would be wonderful.  BON-BON: You know Aunt Jenesa, this Earth is getting a little cramped for Clynn and I. It would be nice to explore the galaxy and its endless riches.  AUNT JENESA: An intergalactic Bonnie and Clyde love story. I love it! Come on!  MARTHA: And we get to ride the spaceship! We can sing campfire songs!  BON-BON: If you want to stay here with him, go ahead and start singing.  MARTHA: Yes ma’am.  Exit Bon-Bon, Clynn and Martha. Danny struggles on the ground. Aunt Jenesa removes the handkerchief from his mouth.  AUNT JENESA: Spit it out.  DANNY: What about your pickles?  AUNT JENESA: I’ve decided to get them somewhere you don’t know about.  DANNY: Aunt Jenesa no!  AUNT JENESA: Tell your mother her sister-in-law said “Hi”.  Exit Aunt Jenesa. Bright light shines on stage and the sound of the spaceship is heard.  DANNY: What now? (Begins singing ‘Khumbaya’ until) I hate that song!
