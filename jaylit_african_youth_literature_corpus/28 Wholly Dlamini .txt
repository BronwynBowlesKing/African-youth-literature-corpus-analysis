Wholly  Blessed are those who have never known love  for they can settle for carbon copies of fake  adoration and pain disguised as love.    Fortunate are those that have never looked in the eyes  of someone who truly loves them for they  maybe satisfied by the look of infatuation  and successfully confuse sex with the act of  love.    Happy are those who never had anyone battle  their demons and love them through it. For  they may be comforted with mere companionship  or the warmth of any human body.
