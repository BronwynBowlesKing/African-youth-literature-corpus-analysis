On Such Days  You are supposed to go straight to the office to face the disciplinary panel where you will either be dismissed or paid in lieu of notice. But somewhere you find yourself in her office, welcomed into a calming space with ambient lighting and Deuter softly playing in the background.  You sit on the couch facing Dr Temi, who sits behind her desk wearing a pantsuit with a pad and a pen in her hands. Her hair is pulled back in cornrows, pushing her face into sharp focus, forcing you to look at her, to really see her. You shift your gaze from her face to the dusky purple wall and the giant blue painting behind her desk.  "How are you, Ayomide?"  She says your name; the way your boss would say it, the way Dara, your wife, would not say it. You take a deep breath; you want to tell her that you don't know what you feel, don't have the vocabulary to describe your feelings.  "I'm fine." You finally find the word and force a smile. This smile is fake and you know that you are afraid to show her what you feel for fear of looking like a wimp.  "How is your work? How are you coping?"  There is an awkward silence, but she waits patiently, not asking further questions, just awaiting your reply.  "I have a shitty job." You stop and look at her. She is writing something on her pad. "Who doesn't?" you continue.  She smiles at you with her eyes. "It’s fine, we don't have to talk about it."  You release a deep breath you didn't know you were holding.  "How is your wife?”  At that you get impatient. "Listen, Dr Temi, I didn't come here to discuss my wife." You clench your teeth, take your suitcase and storm out of her office.                    You do not go home. Rather you find yourself in a club with sorrow-laden eyes. "I will survive," you mutter to yourself, to the glass of alcohol in front of you. You force down the liquid, down your tummy, your first taste of alcohol. You let your mind wander and wander. You ought to be a happy man. That was the initial goal, but limitations had set in, and now you alone know where the shoe pinches.  You are so lost in thought that you do not notice her by your side.  "Mind if I join you?" she flutters her lashes.  "Ok," you nod to affirm this.  "If I may ask, what is a cutie like you doing in a club all by yourself?"  "I needed to be alone," you clear your throat and drag your gaze up to her face, expecting to see the usual sex worker, desperately in need of a man. But you freeze, stunned. She isn't dressed as such, but your eyes get stuck on her full breasts, forming a hard knot of desire in your belly. As if suddenly realizing that you are married, you rise to your feet.  "Sorry, I got to go." You hesitate, clearing your throat again.  "Call me." She fishes out a note from her small handbag and hands it over to you.  "Ok," you barely reply as you turn to leave.    You drag your worn-out body to your room and lock the door behind you. You now enjoy solitude. It gives you the chance to beat your mind into submission. In your room, you pick up your diary and start to read out to yourself commitments which are becoming unbearably heavy. The cost of caring for your aged mother had become a big hole in your pocket. So was the maintenance of your car and the monthly allowance of your house help. Not to talk of your regular bills: rent, electricity, tax...   "Damn it," you shout as rage fills your heart. You close the accursed book and fling it furiously against the wall of your bedroom. No more tears. You will not sit down and cry like a child. You will face your problems squarely, grapple with them like a man with courage.      "Ayo, who is this woman you are seeing? You think I wouldn't find out that you are having an affair?”  Your wife starts to nag. Because it is so typical of her, you don't say a word. So typical of her not to read the pain in your voice and see it in your eyes.  "I thought I married a man but..."  You bring your fist down on her jaw with such force that she staggers back on her feet, eyes red-rimmed and wide.  "Ay... Ayo," she stammers, tears filling her eyes.  Guilt sits on your chest, weighing you down like a ton of bricks. In that moment, you want to reach out to her and take back the horrible thing you had just done, but the thing on your chest won't let you. You storm out of the house, leaving your wife in shock.    ***    "I'm glad you came, Mr Ayo," Dr Temi's eyes meet yours first, and you smile in return. Your gaze sweeps down her features, and you think of how lucky her husband must be.  "I wasn't hoping to see you today. I thought you had terminated the appointment," she said as she pushed away the laptop on her desk. "Let me help you, Ayo."  You close your eyes, breathless. "You don't understand what it is like to be in my shoes. You don't know how I try to live up to the image my wife has of me. How can you possibly help me?”   "You're absolutely right. I haven't had your experience, but I'm interested in what you've gone through. Tell me."  "I lost my job." You bend your head. "My mother has cancer and needs urgent treatment." You turn away, hating yourself for revealing even a glimpse of your vulnerability.  "Does your wife know about this?"  You stifle a laugh, "I can't tell her."  "Why is that?"  "I have been trying to keep things together with the hope that all will be well, you know, play the man." You bite your lips. "She will be disappointed in me because I have failed her."  You glance up at her. She is still writing on her pad.   "If you woke up tomorrow and everything was just the way you wanted it to be, what would be different? How would you be different?"  You close your eyes and see your wife, the way she had looked at you the night you hit her. You see your mother smiling down at you and your boss, patting your shoulder. The image breaks apart. You open your eyes and you are still sitting there, Dr Temi in front of you, awaiting your reply.  "I will be a happy man."  "Then let your wife know you lost your job. Let her see the magnitude of the challenges. Together you can face them."  You give a hard shake of your head and lift your eyes to the ceiling for a moment. When you have more control, you lock eyes with her. "Won't she think less of me?" You say the words fast, as though it hurt too much to let them linger on your lips.  “Love is supposed to be based on trust. It's something rare and beautiful when people can confide in each other without fearing what the other person will think.”     ***    When you are outside, you flip open your phone and call your wife. On the second ring, you hear her pick up.  "I'm sorry for hitting you," you clear your throat.  "Ayo?" Alarm sounds in her voice. "What is it?"  A lump forms in your throat, "It is nothing bad. We just need to talk."  She hesitates, "Are you sure you're ok?"  "Yes." You release a deep breath. "I'm coming home."
