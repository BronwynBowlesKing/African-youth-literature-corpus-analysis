The Home of Darkness    There is darkness, in a world once serene,  Destruction, filth in a place once clean.  She awakes, terrified, in pain, alone.  With surreal realisation that her womb was once a home,  To every man who now has life,  To every father, son, husband of every wife.  To every teacher, driver, postman, men we trust,  Policemen, politicians, none are free of lust.    In agony, she fears, she can’t protect her daughter,  From the darkness of rape, abuse and slaughter.  Her country burns while her leaders sleep,  Their silence is deafening, the insult is deep.  The silent cries of thousands of women ring,  All they’re told is to “pray and sing”.  Her body is perceived as nothing but an object,  The countless violations continue justice unchecked.  But in the darkness, embers have been stoked.  Soon a fire will blaze. She is provoked.  With impunity they now denigrate and mock.  They did not know when you strike a woman, you’ve struck a rock.
