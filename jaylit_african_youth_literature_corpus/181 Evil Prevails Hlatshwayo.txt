Evil Prevails     When we take no opportunity because we say we see none.  When we take no chances because we think we stand none.  When we wish for change but we don’t stand to see it done,  Because we expect it from someone else who we suppose is bound by some obligation  Or qualification or just compassion for our need for mitigation in life.  Evil prevails.    It prevails when I choose to rather let fruit rot before my eyes than to share some  With a hungry stranger because I owe him nothing.  It prevails through ignoring her helpless cry from the street  As she begged for her life, thinking I couldn’t have done a thing.  It prevails when I look away from a freezing, starving child  Towards the blazing fire where my unpreferred clothes burn and feel nothing.  It prevails when a perpetrator hurts me and I say nothing.    Evil prevails where there is absence of love.  Where discrimination and segregation matter more than compassion and togetherness.  Where status weighs more than humanity and arrogance more than happiness.  It prevails where there’s mistrust.  Where deception for personal gain reigns over guidance towards multinational benefit.  Where fear reigns over hope and proof is preferable to truth.  Where lies and betrayal grow in the midst of injustice  And murder is used to protect devious secrets.    It prevails not only when we declare war against one another  But also when we fail to stand together for peace.  It prevails not when we stop preaching the right ways  But when we fail to practice them.  It prevails not when we are not able  But when we are able and yet not willing.  It prevails when good people do nothing.
