  Among all things Amanda    You are like a sweet home  In a thick forest promising no hope    You are like a warm scarf  In a cold morning that never ceases to laugh    You are like a refuge cage  From wild animals coming in rage    You are like a tasty song  For hard journeys that are so long    You are like a white butterfly  Spreading peace with wings in a blue sky    You are like a desert stream  Whose existence is like a king’s dream    You are like an arrowproof shield  For a languished warrior in a battle field    You are like a soft pillow  That makes a fool dream like a hero    You are like a sage  Revealing truths of life hiding in the hedge    But among all things you are my love  A thing that my heart is proud to have
