All the wounds you cannot see    He told you he loved you today, and man  didnt it feel good?  It felt like a warm summer day, tasted like  strawberries dipped in chocolate.    He said youre the one, and boy those words  sounded like your father had never abandoned  your mother and had stayed to raise you.    They sounded like every boy, man youve ever  loved returned to love you.  He said he had never met anyone like you  and its true you know its true, you know,  its true that's why youve had a permanent  smile upon your face since he left.    But he hasnt called has he? with every  sweet word he says he takes a little more  of you.

Now ask yourself how often the word love has  materialized into a verb?
