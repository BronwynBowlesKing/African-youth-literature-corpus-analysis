From my 80s    As we walked along that cold blue sea,  Old age was something we couldn't see,  Seeing you moving just right beside me,  That the sun sets was hard to believe.    Everything in the world has changed,  We can never open our doors to the past,  I can smell the future with a lot of tears,  Hold my hand and let our love conquer our fears,  And let those old songs make us young,  Boris Gardiner with Kool and The Gang,  Waking up with you so that life we can still cherish,  Until the day from the world we perish.    Do you know dear?  That though I seem grey in hair,  Though I cannot still make you happy like a love nightmare,  For you, like mama’s love, I still care?    Love is God’s greatest creation,  Yes am old your beauty has gone,  But tell me love,  Can you feel age in my word?  When I say from the bottom to the top of my world,  I love you so much?
