The African Night    Tonight,  I will dance,  As the night crawls in,  Blending in the rhythm,  The yellow fire,  Picking the beats,  Raising its furnace hands up,  Throwing sparks of flames out,  Inviting the moon,  Who in the same breath,  Has supped all the colors from the earth,  Complementing it with a silver touch,  The river picking it,  Producing floating, twinkling diamonds,  As it whispers the song silently,  Between gigantic trees,  Shaking heads,  To the winds,  Carrying the drum vibrations,  The night,  Keeping the African rhythm,  To the natives alone,  A secret,  Sacred,  Passed from generations,  Stored and known by heart
