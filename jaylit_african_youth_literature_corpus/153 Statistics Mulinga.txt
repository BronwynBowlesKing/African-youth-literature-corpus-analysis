Statistics     Mere numbers  Of casualties of a distant war  Random numbers  Rising steadily  Rising rapidly  Rising constantly  Numbers without a face    Relax.    Closer to home  Knocking on the door  Random nameless figures  Rising still  Raging still  Rising fiercely  A war raging in the distance  Still, faceless numbers    Easy.    In the backyard  The bushfire rages  No firebreaks  Numbers becoming faces  Faces known  Faces loved  Names replacing figures  Not just mere statistics anymore.    Panic.    Fortuitous brews and remedies  Whispers of a vaccine  Truckloads of conspiracy theories  Oodles of misinformation  Slapdash divinations of clear skies  Bushed firefighters, naïve populace  Disappearing names, faces – numbers no more    Confusion.
