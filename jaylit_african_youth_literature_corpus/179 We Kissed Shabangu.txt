We Kissed    (A middle-aged man looking at a mirror)    Black tea with a teabag gasping for air, a pack of cigarettes, and an empty ashtray,  That’s all I need,  what’s missing now is the silence in mind.  I know my thoughts are calmed by smoke,  a bunch of blank pages and a pen.    My bed has become an ocean of tears,  a tear from this heart of mine, the one and the only,  my reasons of day and night, faith to fall or rise.    Faithful deeds  what god?  why is love a sin?  why are sinners haters?  What sin in my lust love?    How does love cage itself to thighs gently touching with palms of truth,  naked our bodies meet.  Do you think the king of this temple won’t find the missing forbidden fruits?    Counting stars in her eyes as my sweat steals her heart,  a heart that should by law belong to another,  she is his queen and I am just a thief for passion.  She is no queen to me and a kingdom tonight sleeps without a queen,  she is in my arms.    The king is lonely without a queen, he is what she knows and vowed  into being with for eternity.  I am just a thief that stole a heart,  betrayed logic of knowing what’s right and what’s wrong,  we did it until birds sang myths of the morning, the truth was, she was in my bed.    What’s right not to be wrong?  What’s wrong not to be right?  Brother, my temptations echo in my heart, unfaithful I was to my own queen with the  heartbeat of the queen that was yours    Yes! We kissed naked, we did,  My bed has become an ocean of tears, a tear from this heart of mine,  now I am pulling myself towards myself,  waiting to be present in my presence.    Nothing could have ever warned me about the voices in my head,  It’s morning now, my tea is cold, ashtray filled with ash,  I have lost time putting my thoughts down like a puzzle,  The world is blurry every time the sun awakes.  I am half awake and half asleep, this person I see now isn’t meant to be me    (stands and looks at the bed)
