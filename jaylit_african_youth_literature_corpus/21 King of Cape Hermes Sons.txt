King of Cape Hermes    I stood on a dusty road beneath a hill  On which she loomed, ominously grey  An expansive, derelict, overgrown ruin  like a gargantuan statue in the jungle  There she stood observing the ocean  A once-majestic titan  From another time, a bygone era –  When she was the Eastern Empress  White, beautiful, regal, perfect.    Now cracked, burned out and broken  like an aged beauty queen  Slowly succumbing to the years  she endlessly observes the blue expanse.    A dim-witted creature smilingly sat  Regarding the endless grey sea  From her once gallant observatory.  His skin, sun-darkened beneath  Filthy tattered rags whipping wildly in the wind.  He looked down on me from his perch  Between the glassless windows of  The once aristocratic titan, the fallen Empress  and proclaimed, “Behold, ye,  I am King of the Cape Hermes.  The most splendid hotel that was, is, and ever will be.”    And lo, the wind stilled, the sky cleared  The ocean quietened. As if nature,  in her omniscience,  to pacify his tortured mind  Whisperingly replied,  “Yes, your Majesty,  You are and it is.”
