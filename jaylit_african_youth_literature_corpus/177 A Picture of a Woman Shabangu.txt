A Picture of a Woman      Yesterday I looked at a mirror.  I wanted to see a woman.  A black woman.  I closed my eyes for a bit, took a breath and opened my eyes.    There she was  Hanging on top of a tree naked with blood dripping like a broken tap of water  the ground swallowing her life away  with wind blowing  the bush comforted the body of the deceased    Yesterday I looked at a mirror.  I wanted to see a woman.  A black woman.  I closed my eyes for a bit longer, took a breath and opened my eyes again.    ‘Look at her!  What a slut  Make-up on point, crop-top on point, weave on point, mini-skirt on point  She walks with lust in-between her thighs on this street  breaking man’s necks, erecting desires and temptations in men’s eyes’  They said she deserved it    Yesterday I looked at a mirror.  I wanted to see a woman.  A black woman.  I closed my eyes for a bit longer and  took a breath and at last,  I opened my eyes.    At night  I heard a scream  But it seemed far.  Drunkards going back home to sober up, our intoxicated youth.  The scream continued, the scream continued, this drunkard disturbing sleep  a pillow over my head, sleep is wondering in my mind and the screams slowly fading to  silence.    It’s morning,  my weary eyes see a newspaper  ‘Missing girls’ on the front page  I did hear screams last night.
