Proud    We are the ones they dont tell you about  the ones with no master our ancients  dreams.    We who do not subscribe to a religion  Who carry no anger from the past.    We who live in the acknowledgement and  blessing of the present.  We are the ones they call proud and why  shouldnt we be proud?    After all we cant all be this black or  this beautiful, this love the love for  ourselves is our vengeance lets never  cease.
